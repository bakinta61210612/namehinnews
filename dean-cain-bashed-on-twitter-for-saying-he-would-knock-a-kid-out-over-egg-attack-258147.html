The Superman alum is trending on social media but it is not for his acting talent.</p><p>It all began with a viral video of Australian Senator Fraser Anning. The senator was speaking at a public event when a teen protestor, who was filming the speech from behind, smacked an egg on Anning’s head.</p><p>The prank did not go over well with the senator, who immediately turned around and punched the kid. His reaction started a chain of events leading to a serious scuffle between the older man and teenager. A group of guys had to break up the fight.</p><p><a href=#>Social media went crazy</a> over the footage. Several were supportive of the boy and opposed the right-winged Anning Islamophobic views and anti-immigration stance. However, it was Cain’s reaction that has sent Twitter into a frenzy.</p><p>https://twitter.com/Henry_Belot/status/1106790914414919681</p><p>“I would have knocked that kid cold,” wrote the former Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman star.</p><p>Now that is enough to get Twitter in an uproar. However, the 52-year-old did not stop there. His next remark is what truly pushed the social media users to attack him.</p><p>“He would have been unconscious if it were up to me,” Cain Tweeted as a follow up to his first response.</p><p>People were angered by the actor’s words and they did not hold back on calling him out. Even though he went on a blocking spree, literally blocking anyone who called him out, the damage had been done. He was enemy number one on Twitter.</p><p>“Oh Dean Cain. I forgot you existed and it turns out that was a good thing,” wrote @oldbiddyyelling</p><p>“I hope Dean Cain gets egged at every convention he attends now we know he’s a garbage human.” Tweeted @gspro15198</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well Dean Cain blocked me. Please send him this and tell him captain america at least isn't a coward <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/q3Qyf51nmN</a></p><p>— Rob Slop (@couchesrob) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 17, 2019</a></p><p>“Dean Cain’s so tough he’s legit blocking everyone who disagrees with him,” posted @xxxcathyxxx</p><p>Twitter was not happy with Dean Cain saying he would knock a teen protestor unconscious. Social media might have forgiven him and moved on.</p><p>However, he decided to block anyone who disagreed with him, which only pissed off Twitter users. Looks like playing a superhero on television did nothing to help him be a superhero in real life.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>One-time fans are angry and even calling for convention organizers to boycott the actor. It is too much or what Cain deserves after his Twitter remarks and childish blocking behavior?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUmq6vecKaoKdlkpbAqbHDZqanZaSstrXAxKtkn6eiYsCixcinnmaglWLEsMHLnWSkpp%2BYuG6tjKSgnWWfqsFuu9WeqWadl5x6osDTmpqkZWJqhXKAlmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dennis-deyoung-19470218-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dennis DeYoung (Rock Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-banner-phone-number.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Banner Phone Number, WhatsApp Number Contact Number Mobile</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
