The discipline and determination cultivated in virtual battles could be applied to real-life challenges with equal efficacy. Gaming became a dojo—a place of learning and self-discovery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Paying_Forward_the_Guidance>Paying Forward the Guidance</span></h2><p>Just as I once received guidance from more experienced players, I now strive to pay it forward to others on their journey.
