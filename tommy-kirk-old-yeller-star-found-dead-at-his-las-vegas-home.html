He was 79.</p><p>The actor was known for his role as Travis Coates in the 1957 film, “Old Yeller.”</p><p>A neighbor found his body at his home in Las Vegas on Tuesday around 8 p.m., according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>. No foul play was expected at the time of discovery.</p><p>The iconic actor starred in the film alongside silver screen legends like Dorothy McGuire, Fess Parker and Kevin Corcoran.</p><p>“Old Yeller” followed the story of a teenage boy who begins to love a stray dog as he helps his family run their Texas home.</p><p>Kirk also lent his talents in Disney classics such as “The Shaggy Dog,” “Swiss Family Robinson” and “The Misadventures of Merlin Jones.”</p><p>He began his career as a child actor and was discovered in 1954 at the age of 13.</p><p>The Kentucky native was reportedly fired from Disney when he was 21 after allegations of homosexuality hit the news in 1964.</p><p>“When I was about 17 or 18 years old, I finally admitted to myself that I wasn’t going to change,” he said during a 1993 interview for Filmfax magazine, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “I didn’t know what the consequences would be, but I had the definite feeling that it was going to wreck my Disney career and maybe my whole acting career. It was all going to come to an end.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Eventually, I became involved with somebody and I was fired,” he continued.</p><p>Kirk was given the honor of being a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney Legend in 2006</a>, but revealed at the time that he was done with movies.</p><p>“Finally, I said to hell with the whole thing, to hell with show business. I’m gonna make a new life for myself, and I got off drugs, completely kicked all that stuff. I went out and started my own business. I’ve done it for years and I live well. I have a nice business, a nice pension, and friends,” he said.</p><p>“I want to be remembered for my Disney work, like&nbsp;‘Swiss Family Robinson’ and&nbsp;‘Old Yeller,’” he continued.</p><p>He also recalled he once saw Walt Disney at a Beverly Hills hotel. “He was with Hedda Hopper, the legendary [gossip] columnist. He put his arm around me, and he said, ‘This is my good-luck piece here,’ to Hedda Hopper. I never forgot that. That’s the nicest compliment he ever gave me.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKS6rsWMpKCro12kuaV52J6jpZ2iYsC1rdFmnaitnpl6pbHAnWSarF2dtrR5y5qqZq6VnK60eceopJ5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./826632-top-catfish-fishing-lures.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top Catfish Fishing Lures | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tay-roc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tay Roc: Rapper, Real Name, Age, Rap Battles, Net Worth !</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
