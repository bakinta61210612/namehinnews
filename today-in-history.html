The group killed around 60 people before a militia crushed the rebellion, and Turner evaded capture for two months.</p><p>When he was caught, he immediately confessed and was hanged and skinned.

She immigrated to the United States at the age of 22 — and everyone close to her began dying mysteriously.

Kelly was a notorious bushranger whom many impoverished Australians saw as a hero for standing up to what they believed was a corrupt police force that protected only the wealthy. He spent years stealing horses and cattle and robbing banks before he was captured during another shootout in June 1880 and put on trial for his crimes.</p><h2>1918: World War I Ends</h2><p>World War I comes to an end at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month after four years of fighting that left at least nine million soldiers and five million civilians dead. Early that morning, Germany signed an agreement with the Allies to end the conflict. But although World War I was the “war to end all wars,” the Treaty of Versailles that officially put a stop to the Great War harshly punished Germany and set the stage for World War II.</p><h2>1934: Grace Budd’s Mother Receives A Letter From Her Killer</h2><p>Delia Flanagan, whose daughter Grace Budd had vanished six years prior, receives <a href=# rel=noopener>a horrific letter</a> that describes her murder in gruesome detail. In June 1928, serial killer <a href=# rel=noopener>Albert Fish</a> murdered and then ate the remains of 10-year-old Budd in Irvington, New York.

Mallon was the first identified asymptomatic carrier of the typhoid bacteria in the United States, and she likely infected up to 120 people with the disease.
