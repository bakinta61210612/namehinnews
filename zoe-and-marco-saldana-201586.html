Two years ago, Saldana and Perego secretly tied the knot. In a nontraditional move, the groom wanted to take his bride's last name, much to her resistance.</p><p>"I tried to talk him out of it," Saldana confessed to the mag. "I told him, 'If you use my name, you're going to be emasculated by your community of artists, by your Latin community of men, by the world.'"</p><p>Her husband's reaction? "Marco looks up at me and says, 'Ah, Zoe, I don't give a s–t.'"</p><p>The couple welcomed their twin boys <strong>Cy </strong>and <strong>Bowie</strong> this past November.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Since I've been with Marco, I've been lowering my guard," Saldana mused to the mag. "Finally when we had our boys, I looked at my husband and I realized: I was meant for you and you were meant for me. I've always felt comfortable around men as long as they were friends. Now I finally feel comfortable with my lover. I don't want to be separate. I want my church. I want to live inside the religion of our own little family."</p><p>In fact, he's also kept her in check when it comes to her post-pregnancy diet — especially as an A-list actress. In an April Facebook post, Saldana told her fellow moms not to "beat yourselves if you fall off the wagon and eat like teenagers."</p><p>"Yesterday we took our friend out for sushi and I swear I ate everything AND the kitchen sink," she shared. "Right before I started my typical routine of self-loathing Marco looked at me and said, 'Z, it's okay. Start again tomorrow.' I loved him for that, he reminded me there always tomorrow to make right what you have undone today. I'm also reminded that this is for life and not a temporary fix. So why am I going to add more stress to my life by putting a deadline on my healthy lifestyle."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaLGonV2Wu6V5zJqpnKddqK6tsMCnmGZqYGaCeYI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pro-wrestlers-bodies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20 Amazing Bodies of Female Pro Wrestlers Celebwell</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zack-snyders-justice-league-cut-is-real-and-its-coming-to-hbo-max-399286.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zack Snyders Justice League Cut Is Real And Its Coming To HBO Max</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
