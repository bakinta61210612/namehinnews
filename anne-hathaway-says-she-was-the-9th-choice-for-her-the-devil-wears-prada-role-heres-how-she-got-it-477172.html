That being said, among other things, <a href=# title="Anne Hathaway Goes Full Pregnancy Glam As She Displays Baby Bump At Modern Love Premiere"><strong>Anne Hathaway</strong></a> revealed that she was not even close to being the first choice for her role in The Devil Wears Prada!</p><p>In fact, she was not even the second or third choice, or fourth, or fifth!</p><p>Instead, the lucky number for her at that time was 9!</p><p>That’s right! According to the actress, she was the ninth choice for the main role but she got it anyway!</p><p>That role nearly went to none other than Rachel McAdams.</p><p>It all started with her being asked if she’d ever fought ‘tooth and nail’ for a role.</p><p>Anne responded with: How much time do you have? A lot of them…I’ll give you the tea, I was the ninth choice for Devil Wears Prada. But I got it! Hang in there, never give up.’</p><p>Variety has also reported that Rachel McAdams was director David Frankel‘s first choice!</p><p>However, she turned it down more than one time.</p><p>Not to mention that there were apparently around a hundred other actresses who auditioned for the tole, including Juliette Lewis and Claire Danes.</p><p>But Anne definitely wanted it the most as she apparently wore ‘hire me’ in the garden outside Andy’s office at the time, with her finger!</p><p>‘I didn’t have to audition. I had to be patient. I wasn’t the first choice.’</p><p>As for the moment she found out she’d gotten the role, she recalled that ‘I was putting on a shirt…I had some buddies over. I still remember running out in my living room, half dressed, screaming — I got The Devil Wears Prada! I got The Devil Wears Prada!’</p><p></p><p>As for the other main character of the movie, it turns out that <strong>Meryl Streep</strong> was almost not the one cast either since she refused to take it.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>She did change her mind when the team offered her double the salary they initially offered her.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRo7umeceaq6GZp5bGbr%2FAsqpmq5iaerit0maroZ1dbsGpecKhpqKblWKzsL6MoZyrZaSdsm6wxK%2BgpWWnmq6zv4ypqZqckWK%2FsLjEZp%2BeqpWoeqm71maqoZ1dnLy1ecitZG1vZ2aEc3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./barbara-rumpel-wikipedia-the-tragic-story-of-a-businesswoman-and-a-mother.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Barbara Rumpel Wikipedia: The Tragic Story of a Businesswoman and a Mother</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./angela-simmons-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Angela Simmons Net Worth | Bio, Family, Address, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
