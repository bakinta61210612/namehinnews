However, what stirred controversy in the headlines was the content of his lyrics, which some fans believe were a shot directly at his fellow rapper, Travis Scott.</p><p>Rocky said in his set, “another victory be flawless like the skin on me, d*mn/please, please don’t compare him and me, you offendin’ me,” and fans were entirely convinced the ex-boyfriend of Kendall Jenner was referring to Travis Scott.</p><p>The rapper went on to reference in his freestyle the classic line from Denzel Washington in American Gangster, “the loudest ones in the room are always the weakest.” Later on, A$AP took to his social media account to address rumors he was referring to Travis Scott.</p><p>Reportedly, A$AP Rocky isn’t thrilled with the idea of fans and others comparing him to the father of Kylie Jenner’s child, Travis Scott. With that said, Rocky claims there has never been a feud between them. This past year, Peter Rosenberg interviewed A$AP Rocky during a sit-down in which he offered praise for the Astroworld artist.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3mNdVjofxC/</p><p>A$AP Rocky said to reporters that he felt as though he was a pioneer in many respects in the hip-hop community, however, he doesn’t get the respect he deserves, or even the acknowledgment. The star added that he thinks a lot of people can see it as well.</p><p>“I think Travis Scott, he makes cool music,” before going on to say that he had just had a child with Kylie Jenner, adding he was happy for the news. A$AP Rocky has been all over the headlines in the last year, but for less than positive reasons.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>This past summer, the rapper was detained by Swedish authorities for an assault on a 19-year-old man. A$AP and his friends were reportedly followed by irate men, whom they then got into a fight with. A$AP was held for approximately one month while he went through the Swedish legal system.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRlr1uvs6corJlk6GuqrnSZqquqKCkwKawjJucnp5drLa1tIytqZqumah6tK%2FOratmoJGoeq27zaBkn5mUmrFurdaasGahpKh6sbjAspydZZ%2BqwW5%2FkmpncHBf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amy-dumas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amy Dumas Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-bond-like-no-other-how-mary-secret-and-promise-bring-joy-to-millions.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Bond Like No Other: How Mary, Secret and Promise Bring Joy To Millions</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
