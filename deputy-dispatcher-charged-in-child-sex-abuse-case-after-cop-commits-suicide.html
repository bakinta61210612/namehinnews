police sergeant confessed to sexually abusing children and implicated two co-workers in the crimes, during a dramatic standoff with investigators and a SWAT team that ended in his suicide, authorities said on Friday.</p><p>Deputy Robert Johnson, an eight-year veteran of Harris County Precinct One in Houston, shot himself in the head Wednesday, after being pursued by police who were tipped off to his abuse by a dispatcher that turned out to also be an accomplice in the attacks, police said.</p><p>Dispatcher Christina McKay and Deputy Chonda Williams were arrested for their alleged roles in the crimes and fired on Friday, Harris County Precinct One Constable Alan Rosen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said at a press conference Friday</a>.</p><p>The shocking string of events that led to their arrests began on May 14, when McKay was brought in for a performance review, Rosen told reporters.</p><p>“We pulled her in because we were started to see some performance problems, and we wanted to find out what was going on in her life, what was happening,” Rosen said. “Initially it seemed like a love triangle thing.”</p><p>McKay told police that she was personally involved with Johnson — and said he had been sexually abusing children, according to the constable.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Chonda Williams along with another coworker were arrested due to their alleged roles in the abuse of a child. <span class=credit>Harris County Constable’s office</span></figure><p>“And so that’s when we started learning… what she was going through, only for her to make this outcry that there was this problem,” Rosen said.</p><p>Officials turned the case over to police in nearby Alvin, Texas, where the abuse allegedly occurred, and they teamed up with child protective services to try and question Johnson, who was nowhere to be found, according to police.</p><p>“He never showed up for work at all this week,” Rosen said.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Christina McKay was the dispatcher who alerted the police to Robert Johnson’s abuse and was later arrested for her alleged role in the crime. <span class=credit>Harris County Constable’s office</span></figure><p>On Wednesday, McKay called investigators and said she was at a local lake with Johnson, who was armed, and threatening violence, officials revealed.</p><p>“She claimed that she feared for her life and that he was suicidal,” Rosen explained.</p><p>Local and state police arrived at lake, but Johnson led them on a chase, cops said.</p><p>Cops followed Johnson to a bridge, where he was boxed in — and he eventually made a full confession, according to police.</p><p>“We spoke to Johnson. [Internal Affairs} Chief Harrison spoke to Johnson for hours, because it was important to us to try to prevent a suicide, and to most importantly get every and any and all facts relative to this case that we could get from him,” Rosen said.</p><p>“Johnson confessed to everything he had done and he implicated two other employees at this office, Christina McKay and Deputy Chonda Williams.”</p><p>After the “thorough confession,” the deputy turned the gun on himself, Rosen said.</p><p>“There was just no indication whatsoever that a guy like this had these demons in him,” the emotional constable explained.</p><p>“He’s going to have to answer to that with his maker. I can’t do anything for him. The only thing I can do is be here for these victims,” Rosen said.</p><p>“Everybody around this guy had no idea that he was a pedophile”</p><p>McKay and Williams were “terminated, charged and arrested,” in connection with the case. They were being held at the Brazoria County Jail.</p><p>The FBI has joined the investigation and authorities are working to determine if additional children were abused.</p><p>“Nobody saw this coming,” Rosen said. “This has been a tragic week and we pray for the victims.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlJq9tsDYZpuiq6CWwaS0xKtknKCRp7SmsIyipWabmJ65pXnSnq9mmZKqwKZ5wpqqnmWRm8Gmvoycpqllk6S6rrXTrGSsrZmYtqWxjniYpqg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./empires-epic-finale-sex-death-pregnancy-prison-who-survived-2015193.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Empire's Epic Finale: Sex, Death, Pregnancy, Prison - Who Survived?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./144381-dbn-gogo-kamo-mphela-young-stunna-black-panther-wakanda-soundtrack-sa-proud.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>DBN Gogo, Kamo Mphela, Young Stunna &amp;amp; Others Make It on Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Soundtr</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
