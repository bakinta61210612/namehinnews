A proud competitor for three quarters of a century and valued part of WWE to her last day, Young truly blazed a path for future female grapplers beginning in the 1940s.</p><p>From the moment she first stepped through the ropes, Young established herself as one of the most active and successful female Superstars â€“ including becoming the first U.S. Women's Champion, carrying out one of the most storied rivalries of the time with the legendary Mildred Burke in 1954 and being among the first female competitors to tour post-war Japan.</p><p>(...)</p><p><span>The entire WWE Universe offers a standing ovation to a true queen of the canvas and bids Mae Young a heartfelt farewell.</span></p><p><span>Vince McMahon added his thoughts as well (via WWE's Director of Public Relations and Corporate Communications Adam Hopkins):</span></p><p>There will never be another Mae Young.&nbsp; Her longevity in sports entertainment may never be matched, and I will forever be grateful for all of her contributions to the industry. &nbsp;On behalf of WWE, I extend our sincerest condolences to her family and friends.&nbsp;</p><p>WWE's Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon was quick to pay her respects to Young:</p><p>WWE announcer Jim Ross added:</p><p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson also passed along his thoughts:</p><p>It was initially reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marc Middleton</a>&nbsp;of WrestlingInc.com on Dec. 31 that Young had been hospitalized and moved to Hospice care after being scheduled to appear on the Jan. 6 Old School edition of Raw.</p><p>A number of people involved with the business sent their thoughts and prayers to Young and her family after the news officially broke, including former WWE Diva Mickie James:</p><p>Current WWE announcer and former WWE Champion JBL offered his condolences as well:</p><p>WWE Superstar Zack Ryder shared a great moment that he had with the incomparable Young:</p><p>The outpouring of thoughts regarding Young didn't come only from the WWE family, though, as TNA owner Dixie Carter had some kind words too:</p><p>Former WWE Superstar and current ROH wrestler Matt Hardy was extremely complimentary of the legendary female trailblazer:</p><p>Even the normally outrageous Iron Sheik was saddened by news of Young's passing:</p><p>Young's wrestling career began in 1939, and she remained a visible figure within the business until her passing. She continued to make sporadic appearances for WWE well into her golden years, and she became beloved by the fans for her spunk.</p><p>When Young faced Team Laycool in a handicap match in 2010, she earned the incredible distinction of being the first person to compete in a match nine different decades. Most fans know Young for what she has done over the past 15 years, but she was a top-notch grappler during her prime.</p><p>In fact, Young was an NWA fixture as she captured the NWA Women's Florida, United States and World Tag Team Championships.</p><p>Most wrestlers would be content to hang up the boots at the age of 76, but that wasn't the case with Young. Against all odds, she resurrected her career in 1999 at the height of the Attitude Era and developed a cult following of sorts.</p><p>She and fellow WWE Hall of Famer The Fabulous Moolah began to get involved in angles with the likes of Jeff Jarrett and The Dudley Boyz. Rather than simply doing a little bit of talking, though, Young made her presence felt physically.</p><p>Most famously, Young was twice powerbombed through a table by Bubba Ray Dudley, which solidified her reputation as the toughest female wrestler of all time.</p><p>Proving her toughness is something that Young always took pride in. According to Young during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Nation</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;SLAM! Wrestling&nbsp;prior to her induction into the WWE Hall of Fame, Young was well-schooled in wrestling from a young age.</p><p><span>"My brother and I went to school together, and he was on the boys' amateur wrestling team," explained Young. "He taught me all of the amateur wrestling holds so I was a good wrestler. When we went to school, he would go down the street and say, 'I bet my sister could whip you.' So, I was wrestling all of my life."</span></p><p><span>Young also expressed a willingness and desire to wrestle for as long as she was physically capable during the interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nation</a>&nbsp;in 2008.</span></p><p><span><span>"I live to wrestle for the fans because they keep me going," continued Young. "I'm 85 years old, and I still plan on wrestling when I'm a hundred. I look forward to seeing all of the fans. When I look out from the ring and see the fans cheering, hollering, booing, whatever; it's always exciting to me."</span></span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, Young won't accomplish her ultimate goal, but she did more within the business of professional wrestling than most could ever hope to. In fact, she redefined longevity by remaining relevant for as long as she did, which is something that many can learn from.</span></p><p><span>Young was one of a kind, and it is highly unlikely that any female wrestler will be able to replicate the impact she had on professional wrestling.</span></p><p><span>Young more than earned the label of wrestling legend, and she will forever be fondly remembered by fans because of that.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaHJpY26BeHnWsJxmoJGhuW67xWadmqWVp3qurcRmsKitnpx6sa3SrJysZZGsrrp5wK1kmp%2BVYoZx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1456416-wwes-top-10-of-2012-no-7-randy-orton-suspended-for-60-days.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WWE's Top 10 of 2012, No. 7: Randy Orton Suspended for 60 Days | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, an</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-zack-greinkes-wife-emily-greinke.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Zack Greinkes Wife Emily Greinke?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
