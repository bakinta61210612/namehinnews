Photo / Supplied</p><p>Residents in Auckland’s Te Atatū were left feeling scared as police swarmed in on a local sports club as a “disorder” incident unfolded.</p><p>Police were called to the incident at Te Atatū Rugby League Club, home of the Te Atatū Roosters, on Titoki St last night – and initial reports suggested there had been a stabbing.</p><p>“While there was an initial information received that a person had been stabbed, police inquiries at the clubrooms were not able to establish this,” said a police spokesperson.</p><p>Chairman of the Te Atatū Roosters Craig Godfrey said he was “disappointed” the incident had taken place as they were trying to turn the club around.</p><p>It was the first game of the season, and in eight months, for the team.</p><p>“We’ve tried to become a family club and repurpose ourselves as a community hub,” said Godfrey.</p><p>“Situations like the one we had go against all the work that we’ve done in the other direction to try and promote the game.”</p><p>Godfrey was “grateful” to the large number of police who responded to the incident.</p><p>He said around 7pm a group of about 30 young men started to become “argie-bargie” with one another, and so they decided to clear everyone out of the club.</p><p>The altercation proceeded in the carpark and seven people were arrested he said.</p><p>A resident of the area, Hannah Wilson, heard a helicopter fly over and took her 20-month-old son outside to have a look when she was “yelled” at by police to remain inside.</p><p>“It was really scary as the police had guns and there was so many of them. At first I thought it might have been an escaped prisoner so we locked our doors and stayed inside,” she said.</p><p>Shortly after Wilson went back outside to have a look and noticed a line-up of police officers across the road closer to Toru St.</p><p>“There were lots of police, they had guns and dogs,” she said.</p><p>At one point the helicopter also shone its light into the window of her house, said Wilson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnoKS5qq%2FEZqqwmaKieqq6jKilZpyZqLyzsMSrZKKmk56xprrTZpitZaOlvLPA0maapa2SYr%2Bwu8ysZKKmXayytMCMmqyco5yWu6V50p6tnqqRoXqivtGeqq2dlGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1572490-pros-and-cons-for-recruits-attending-7-on-7-recruiting-camps.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pros and Cons for Recruits Attending 7-on-7 Recruiting Camps | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paulina-alexis-wikipedia-age-parents-nauzin-alexis-yvette-alexis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paulina Alexis Wikipedia And Age: Parents Nauzin Alexis And Yvette Alexis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
