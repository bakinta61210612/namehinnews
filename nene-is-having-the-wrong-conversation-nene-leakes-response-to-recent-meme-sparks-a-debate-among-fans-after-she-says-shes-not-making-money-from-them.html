spotlight, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nene Leakes</a></strong> has become arguably one of the most meme-worthy personalities out there, and it looks like she has set her sights on monetizing the content that has been shared countless times across the internet.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Linnethia Lounge owner</a> and TV personality has provided internet users with continuously funny moments and quotable sayings, the latest of which is a resurfaced season-two clip of Leakes running while wearing heels during a Heel The Soul charity race.</p><img

has gone viral, Nene and her jog have been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">edited</a> into all kinds of hilarious scenes from movies, including “The Lion King,” “Jurassic Park,” “Avengers:

Real Housewives of Atlanta” star was taking the onslaught of jokes in stride, her response indicated that she wasn’t. “Joy? Not really!” she tweeted. “I’m not making a dime off any of these thousands of meme #smh never have.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-17-at-8.32.13-PM-600x148.png><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">credit</a> and monetization of popular internet content, including memes and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> dances, has made for a growing topic of discussion with their increasing popularity. Black TikTok creators recently went on strike to protest the lack of credit they were receiving for the dances they choreographed that went on to go viral and, in turn, make money for the platform and artists whose songs they sampled.</p><p>“TikTok is a special place because of the diverse and inspiring voices of our community, and our Black creators are a critical and vibrant part of this,” TikTok responded in a statement. “We care deeply about the experience of Black creators on our platform and we continue to work every day to create a supportive environment for our community while also instilling a culture where honoring and crediting creators for their creative contributions is the norm.”</p><p>As for Nene, fans were taken aback by her response and debated whether or not she actually had a point, or should just laugh and enjoy the free publicity.</p><p>“Nene is having the wrong conversation. She had years to license and trademark so much of her own content during the height of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#RHOA</a>-mania. But she didn’t. Now, she mad her herself bc she thought Bravo would always need her and that’s not how employment works,” said one fan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nene is having the wrong conversation.</p><p>She had years to license and trademark so much of her own content during the height of <a href=#>#RHOA</a>-mania.
