It prompted private replies from Durant calling Rapoport a “b—h” and a “d—head.”</p><p>Rapoport didn’t back down from Durant and seemed to egg on one of the NBA’s greatest talents for a while by telling him to “go help the kids in Brownsville, Brooklyn and stop being a f—ing p—.”</p><p>But it appears to have reached the boiling point when Durant involved Rapoport’s family. Rapoport shared the messages with a snake emoji and said Durant “is now threatening me, bringing up my wife and wants to fight. This is supposed to be America’s sweetheart right?”</p><p>Durant, who has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not played for the Nets since injuring his hamstring</a> on Feb. 13, did not refute the messages came from him. Instead, he offered a strange defense of his behavior on Twitter: “Me and mike talk CRAZIER than this on the regular and today he’s pissed….My bad mike, damn!!”</p><p>He also wrote on Instagram, “I would never fight mike…The Portnoy thing was too far I see…my bad I apologize.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I receive threats and disgusting messages DAILY, but never in my wildest dreams did I think <a href=#>@KDTrey5</a> would be among them. The ? himself is now threatening me, bringing up my wife and wants to fight. This is supposed to be America’s sweetheart right? <a href=#>#ImDaRealMVP</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/l1VQfGMMRF</a></p><p>— MichaelRapaport (@MichaelRapaport) <a href=#>March 30, 2021</a></p></figure><p>Durant relentlessly went after Rapoport over a defamation lawsuit the actor filed three years ago against Barstool Sports. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A U.S. Southern District Court Judge tossed out the lawsuit Friday</a>. It was centered around a T-shirt depicting Rapaport as a clown with a red mark on his chin — which Rapaport claims insinuated he had herpes.</p><p>The crude terms used by Durant include telling Rapoport “all u do is c— suck other men for attention,” calling him a “piece of s–t,” telling him to “suck a d–k“ and adding “u called your lawyer like the p—y you are.”</p><p>At one point, in an undated message, Durant told Rapoport he would “spit in your face” and challenged him to a meeting on West 17th St. at 10 a.m. He also threatened to come by Rapoport’s residence if given the address.</p><p>Rapaport has two children with ex-wife, writer and producer Nichole Beattie, and re-married actress Kebe Dunn.</p><p>“Your wife mad as f–k cuz u wasting that little bit of money on a lawyers (sic) cuz u can’t take a joke,” Durant wrote with an exaggerated “haha,” before continuing, “how p—y are you. Your wife doesn’t even respect your b—h a–.”</p><p>Rapoport, a native New Yorker with more than 120 television and movie credits since the 1990s, <a href=#>went on ESPN’s “The Michael Kay Show”</a> Tuesday to further the story. He admitted “a lot” of his own responses to Durant were omitted and implied that Durant might be not thinking clearly on pain medications.</p><p>“I first thought he was talking crap how he talks crap,” Rapoport said on air. “So, during that exchange, it went from friendly banter to he made threats, the threats that you read. And what’s excluded from the responses is me basically going, ‘Is this dude serious?’ ”</p><p>“And then I told him, ‘You’re not doing anything to me. You must not know who I am. You’re doing nothing to me. And if I see you, you’re doing nothing to me. And I promise you you’re doing nothing to me. And I’ll meet you anyplace, anytime. I’ll come courtside to your games. You, Kevin Durant, are doing nothing to me.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Kevin Durant, Michael Rapaport<span class=credit>Charles Wenzelberg/New York Post; Paul J. Bereswill</span></figure><p>Rapaport rejected Durant’s notion of friendly banter.</p><p>“He started a conversation by saying, ‘I’m gonna spit in your face,’ ” he told co-host Peter Rosenberg. “You’re not spitting in my face. That’s not friendly banter. If I go, ‘Oh, Peter Rosenberg, yo, you look like you put on some weight,’ that’s ball-breaking. You’re not telling me we’re gonna spit in my face and then bring up my wife and think we’re cool. We’re not cool. We’re not cool.</p><p>“I finally was like, ‘You’re talking to me like — I don’t know what you’re talking to me like.’ Maybe I don’t know what he got his hands on out there in Brooklyn. I know he’s on pain medication. I don’t know. Who knows? I’m not saying anything. I’m just saying maybe he’s bored.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnZ6wqa3EpWSrmaCWvbC%2B02apnq6Vlrm0ec2aqq2xXZuytrCMsKCtoF2jsrW%2FjKyrmqpdoLK3tc1mm66qkaPBcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./morgane-polanski-phone-number.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Morgane Polanski Phone Number, WhatsApp Number, House Address, Email Id</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-siegemund.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Laura Siegemund</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
