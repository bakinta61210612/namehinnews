Unfortunately, this means they can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sometimes be shut down</a> due to circumstances out of their control. And now, Sam's Club and other grocery stores have announced they're closing locations. Read on to see if the changes will affect your go-to option.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>6 Secrets Kroger Doesn't Want You to Know</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/iStock-459027699.jpg><p>A Sam's Club location in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Grapevine, Texas</a>, will remain permanently closed, local ABC affiliate WFAA reports. The store at 1701 W State Hwy 114 initially shuttered after it received "extensive damage" when two EF-1 tornadoes touched down in the area on Dec. 13 of last year.</p><p>The extreme weather damaged other stores in the area, including a Walmart, Discount Tire, and a local mall, the outlet reports. And while five people reported injuries, none were life-threatening.</p><p>Employees were still inside when the tornadoes hit the store, which ripped off portions of the roof. "When air conditioning units are flying through the air, and not one of them landed on a car, a roof, or let alone a person—it's just amazing," <strong>Chuck Paschke</strong>, a nearby business owner and witness to the storm, told WFAA.</p><p>When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Sam's Club told Best Life: "After careful consideration and a thorough damage assessment, we have made the difficult business decision to close our Grapevine, Texas location that incurred extensive damage during the storm last December. This decision aligns with the long-term growth strategy for our company."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/shutterstock_286078760.jpg><p>Although natural disasters can force some businesses to suddenly shut their doors, some can shut down due to other conditions that are out of their control. That includes a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Rainbow Foods</a> grocery store in Smiths Station, Alabama, which will close its doors in the coming weeks, local ABC affiliate WTVM reports.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"It was time to renew the lease and we chose not to because of the inflation and everything," <strong>Lynn Shelley</strong>, the store's owner, told the news outlet. "Just different stores opening up on us and sales are off, so it wouldn't have been profitable to sign another lease."</p><p>Although there are still three other locations of the brand left standing in the local and adjacent counties, some regular shoppers said they were concerned about the change. "This was our only convenience and I don't understand it," <strong>Vickie Bentley</strong>, a Smiths Station resident, told WTVM.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel=noopener>For more up-to-date information, sign up for ourdaily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/shutterstock_767474008.jpg><p>Other small towns will also be losing a critical convenience in the coming weeks. The Save-A-Lot in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Wayne, West Virginia</a>, is slated to close its doors within a month, local CBS affiliate WOWK reports.</p><p>The location has served the local community since 1999. According to owner <strong>Tami Kilgore</strong>, the store's parent company sent a 30-day notice on April 8 demanding the removal of any mention of the Save-A-Lot from the premises.</p><p>"Over the last few months, we have been working with the operator of the Wayne, West Virginia store to overcome identified operational challenges," the company told WOWK in a statement. "Ultimately, we were unsuccessful and, as a result, have terminated the license at this location."</p><p>Kilgore says that her family hopes to open up another grocery store with a different company name—especially as customers voice their concerns. "It's been a lifesaver for us in this area. The only other grocery store we have is on down the road," <strong>Kathy Simpkins</strong>, a local resident, told WOWK.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/closed-sign-kirbys-restaurants-last-location.jpg><p>Small, independent markets can play an essential role in serving their communities. That's why <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Ceresco, Nebraska</a> residents&nbsp;are sorry to lose Sweet Pea Grocers, which is closing after 10 years in business, the Lincoln Journal Star reports.</p><p>"It is time to move on to our next adventure and open a new chapter in our lives," the store wrote in a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Facebook post</a> announcing the closure. "We want to express our thanks and appreciation to our customers and friends. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve the community."</p><p>The shop is currently discounting its entire inventory at 20 percent off before closing its doors for good. The town of Ceresco will be left without a dedicated grocery store once Sweet Pea shutters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmrJmdqHqkuNSbZKCqn5iys8WMrKuoqpWoeqS4zqygp59do7K4v44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-was-julia-roberts-in-pretty-woman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Old Was Julia Roberts In 'Pretty Woman'?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./flossmoor-police-shooting-residents-demand-justice-after-madeline-miller-64-killed-by-police-responding-to-domestic-call.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Flossmoor police shooting: Residents demand justice after Madeline Miller, 64, killed by police resp</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
