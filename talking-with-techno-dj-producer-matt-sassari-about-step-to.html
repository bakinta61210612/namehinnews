This one is geared towards those late-night warriors who love breaking it down on the dancefloor. Now stop reading and get to moving!”</p><p>Sassari’s rendition of “Step To” leans into the darker side of house music, hitting hard from the moment you press play and setting an ominous tone. While Melody’s Enemy takes no prisoners in his rendition, completely transforming the original into a techno track with a frenetic, adrenaline-inducing pace.</p><p>Although relatively new to the scene, Sassari has dropped music on labels such as Terminal M, Intec, Tronic, Relief, and Sci + Tec, amassing millions of streams on Spotify as well as more than 3.6 million monthly listeners.</p><p>CelebMix <a href=#>spoke</a> with Matt Sassari to discover more about techno music, the difference between the music scene in France and the U.S., and how his sound evolved.</p><p><strong>Hey Matt, thanks for taking the time, and congratulations on your newest release. What inspired your new EP, Step To?</strong></p><p>Hello CelebMix. Thanks for having me! I was inspired mainly by the vocal and rolling bass.</p><p><strong>Melody’s Enemy is a really interesting choice for the remixer. What’s the thought process behind the selection?</strong></p><p>Yes, I love this remix from Melody’s Enemy, and we received a list of remixers from TIAL Records, and Melody’s Enemy was my choice.</p><p><strong>You’ve released a bunch of records on TIAL. What about the label drew you to them?</strong></p><p>Yes, this is my third release on TIAL, and I am very happy to work with them, they have a great team! I’ve been introduced to the label owner The Archer by Sian (Octopus) who presented me with the label/project which I immediately liked!</p><p><strong>What’s the biggest difference in the US music scene compared to your home country?</strong></p><p>In my eyes, the US music scene is more open right now than here in Europe. We can now see many big festivals/clubs/events in the US booking fresh new artists from House to Techno which is amazing!</p><p><strong>Some people say techno (or house music) is boring because it’s too repetitive – what say you to that?</strong></p><p>Because they didn’t find the groove YET ha-ha or they didn’t listen to it deeply, you know. OR they are listening to this new Fast/Hard Techno 150bpm which I agree, is boring …</p><p><strong>Did your sound evolve naturally, or did you deliberately push it in a certain direction?</strong></p><p>It evolved naturally, since I started to produce music, I’ve always been between Techno/Tech-House and I won’t push it in a certain direction, this is something I can’t control when I produce.</p><p><strong>Have you always been an electronic music guy? Or are there other genres you frequently listen to?</strong></p><p>I’ve been listening to electronic music since I was very young, but I’m listening to a lot of different genres like rap, pop, etc.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, who are some of the most innovative producers in the game today?</strong></p><p>I would say Fred Again and Eliza Rose with her amazing track B.O.T.A.</p><p><strong>If you could change anything about the music industry, what would it be and why?</strong></p><p>Less social media, to be more focused on the music, which is the most important thing to me! The rest is just noise…</p><p><strong>Could you share your biggest goal in life?</strong></p><p>Ha-ha, difficult but I would say to be able to live from what I love to do which is producing and touring all around the world to spread my music.</p><p>Follow Matt Sassari <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>Twitter</a> | <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>Spotify</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kwaK4yqKloGWnnsGpedOemqGmn2Kxq3nPq6adrZOav265wK2rZquRqMCivshmmJunpal6tMDEqWStp18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-unexpected-image-of-katie-holmes-in-love-surprised-fans-with-frankness-523222.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The unexpected image of Katie Holmes in love surprised fans with frankness</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sweet-child-o-mine-lead-singer-rose-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sweet Child o' Mine lead singer Rose</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
