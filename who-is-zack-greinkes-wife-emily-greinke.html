A former cheerleader and beauty queen, Emily started dating Zach while they were still high schoolers. Therefore, she was in his life when his career was nearly derailed in its early stages by bouts of anxiety and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>depression</a>.</p><p>She was also there and assisted him as he got over his issues and went on to become a star pitcher in the MLB. The couple has formalized their vows and welcomed lovely children in the course of their union. Emily proudly showcases her lovely family on Instagram, and now that her husband is facing the daunting prospect of free agency, she is there to help him figure out the next stage in his career efforts.<br></p><h2><strong>Profile Summary of&nbsp;</strong><strong>Emily Greinke&nbsp;</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Emily Kuchar Greinke</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> N/A</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 12th of November 1984</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 39 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign: </strong>Scorpio</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christian</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> married</li><li><strong>Husband:</strong> Zach Greinke</li><li><strong>Children:</strong> three, namely Bode, Griffin, and Jody</li><li><strong>Parents:</strong> Walter and Bonnie Kuchar</li><li><strong>Sibling:</strong> Nick Kuchar</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Zach Greinke’s wife</li><li><strong>Instagram:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Emily Greinke</a></li><li><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Emily Greinke</a></li><li><strong>Facebook:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Emily Greinke</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Emily Greinke is a Native of Florida Just like her Famous Hubby</strong></h2><p>Zack Greinke’s Wife, Emily Greinke, is 39 years old as she was born on the 12th of November 1984. Her nationality is American, while her ethnicity is Caucasian. Emily Greinke grew up in the town of Apopka, Florida, alongside her parents, Walter Kuchar and Bonnie Kuchar. She also has a brother named Nick Kuchar. Nick holds a degree from Auburn College, Alabama, and is now an artist based in the town of Hawaii.</p><p>On his part, Emily Greinke’s husband, Zach, is a native of Orlando, Florida, and was born on the 21st of October 1983. He has German ancestry, and his parents’ names are Donald and Marsha Greinke. As a child, Zach grew up in Orlando and had an affinity for sports such as tennis, golf, and baseball. He particularly stood out in baseball and played in the minor league and the senior league. He led his senior league team to the Senior League World Series title in 1999.</p><h2><strong>She is a Former Cheerleader, Beauty Queen, and One-Time Miss Daytona Beach USA</strong></h2><p>Emily Greinke spent her formative years in Apopka and attended Apopka High School. She completed her high school diploma around 2002 and was hired as a cheerleader for one of the most valuable sports franchises globally, the Dallas Cowboys, from 2003 to 2004. She also took part in the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Miss Daytona Beach USA</a> Beauty Pageant 2008 and emerged victoriously. Greinke’s career has largely tapered off since then, and she now focuses her efforts on a travel and styling blog. She is also happy to run the home front and support her husband.</p><p>Zach Greinke played four years of high school baseball at Apopka High School and was so wonderful that he led his school to three district titles. This earned him the prestigious honor of Gatorade National Player of the Year, and he received several scholarships. He, however, turned those down and signed on to play for the Kansas Royals in 2002. Zach spent two years in the minor leagues, during which he continued his impressive exploits. He was then called up to the MLB in 2004.</p><p>Since then, Zach has established himself as one of the best pitchers in the history of the game. Even though he has yet to win a world series, he has collected several accolades, including the AL Cy Young Award (given to the best pitcher in the league), Golden Glove Award (6x), Silver Slugger Award (2x), and All-Star (6x). He has been praised for his pitches which have been likened to science.</p><h2><strong>Emily Greinke and Zach Greinke Began Dating in High School and Weded in 2009</strong></h2><p>Emily Greinke first <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>met</a> her future husband, Zach Greinke, during their days at Apopka High School. This was around 1999/2000, and they became friends. They later started dating. The couple dated all through the remainder of their high school days and continued their relationship even after they graduated. Not even the fact that they had to head off to different cities in pursuit of their paths could come between their love stories. Greinke and Zach later got the chance to live together under the same roof, and their love continued to blossom. They later got engaged and wed in the year 2009. The couple has been married for about 14 years now, and their relationship keeps on going strong.</p><p>Greinke has been a pillar of support for her husband through the topsy turvy of his demanding career. Going into the MBL, Zach had a reputation as a prodigy, and many expected him to set the league alight. The opposite, however, turned out to be the case. The pitcher was naturally introverted and couldn’t cope with the publicity. He suffered social anxiety disorder and depression, which marred his first two seasons. He thought of quitting the game, but Greinke and others convinced him otherwise. They rather made sure that he got the help he needed in the form of therapy and drugs, and he was able to bounce back strongly in his career.</p><h2><strong>The Couple Have Three Sons Together, Namely Bode, Griffin, and Jody</strong></h2><p>Emily Greinke and her husband make their home in Los Angeles and have welcomed <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>three sons</a> in the course of their marriage. The first is Bode Nicholas Greinke, born on the 23rd of July 2015. Their second is Griffin, who was born in 2017, while their third, Jody Zachary, was born in November 2021. Emily and the kids regularly visit the stadia to watch Zach in action. They also hang out with him in the clubhouse and exercise. Greinke regularly posts pictures of these heartwarming family outings on her social media, and there is no gainsaying the fact that this stability has impacted her husband positively.</p><p>The personal contentment that Zach has off the field means that he can bring his best to the field, and he has even alluded to this in interviews. The award-winning pitcher has stated that just being with his wife and looking into her eyes makes him feel good. He has also made it known that the best part of his career is when the kids can <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>come out</a> and watch him play/practice. Therefore, when this is impossible, as happened during the covid-19 pandemic period, the pitcher doesn’t find the game so enjoyable anymore.</p><h2><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h2><p>Emily Greinke, born Emily Kuchar, is a prominent figure in the beauty industry and a well-known celebrity wife.
