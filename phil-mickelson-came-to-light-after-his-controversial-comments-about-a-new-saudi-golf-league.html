In November 2021, the American golfer lambasted the Saudi kingdom when chatting with his biographer Alan Shipnuck. At the time, the sportsman expressed his worries about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record and said that he ignored the claimed flaws to restructure the PGA Tour’s operations:</p><p>“We know they murdered [Washington Post writer and US resident Jamal] Khashoggi and have a terrible human rights record… Why would I ever contemplate it, knowing all of this? Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to change the way the PGA Tour functions.”</p><p>The golfer went on to argue that Saudi Arabia’s financial assistance has given players “leverage” to effect significant changes on the PGA Tour:</p><p>“Saudi money has finally provided us with that leverage.” I’m not sure I really want [the SGL] to succeed, but the very existence of it allows us to get things done with the [PGA] Tour.”</p><p></p><p>Following the publishing of the interview, Phil Mickelson received harsh criticism from fans and contemporaries, including Rory McIlroy and Billy Horschel. The golfer eventually confirmed the incident and apologized publicly on Twitter.</p><h2>“I never intended to injure anybody,” Phil Mickelson said.</h2><p>On Tuesday, February 22, in response to Alan Shipnuck’s interview, Phil Mickelson addressed his controversial statements on Saudi Arabia and apologized for his problematic “choice of words.” Despite the uproar, he said his actions were always in the “best interests of golf, peers, sponsors, and fans.” The athlete also stated that his remarks were “reckless” and “offended” individuals.” He went on to say that his statements did not represent his “genuine sentiments or intentions.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Phil-Mickelson-2.jpg alt="Phil Mickelson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Phil Mickelson said that he was aware that the concept of trying something new would be received with criticism. On the other hand, Mickelson alleged that his statement contained several “off-the-record statements” that were disseminated “out of context” without prior approval. Meanwhile, the athlete expressed disappointment and said he would take the required measures to “self-reflect and learn” from the incident. Speaking further about his ambitions, the athlete said that golf needs to evolve and believed actual change comes with disruption.</p><h2>Mickelson apology</h2><p>In addition, the golfer gave his long-term sponsors and investors a gift “In light of the current events, you have the choice to “pause or cancel the partnership.” The three-time Masters champion also said that he has made several errors in his life but has never sought to inflict “hurt”:</p><p>“I’ve made a lot of errors throughout my life, and many of them have been made public.” My intention was never to injure anybody, and I sincerely apologize to those I have harmed.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>A Statement from Phil Mickelson <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2saaXIxhpu</a></p><p>— Phil Mickelson (@PhilMickelson) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 22, 2022</a></p><p>Mickelson concluded his apology by stating he knew he needed to be held “accountable for his behavior.” The sportsman also said that he has been badly impacted by pressure and stress for more than a decade and that he needs a break to prioritize his loved ones while focusing on being the man he “wants to be.” In reaction to Mickelson’s apologies, interviewer Alan Shipnuck said that Mickelson’s statements regarding “off the record” remarks being published were “absolutely incorrect.” Meanwhile, KPMG, a worldwide accounting firm and Phil Mickelson’s longstanding sponsor declared that the business had “mutually decided” to sever its relationship with the golfer in light of the recent incident. In addition, the group wished him well in his future pursuits.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Golfer</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Phil Mickelson</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinoaGcYrqqr8qeo6ynnmKwornEZquoZZyetKnAjJqdrZ2iYrWqv4ycpqesoqTDpr7SopilZZOkuq6xza2qZpmSpMK1ecBmpZ6vXaiutrDIZp6opJZiuaatxq6caA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./playlist-celebmix-sunday-sesh-no-4.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>PLAYLIST: CelebMix Sunday Sesh No. 4</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paris-hiltons-house-robbed-again-201358.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paris Hilton's Malibu Home Robbed for the 7th Time: &amp;quot;I Have Bad Luck&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
