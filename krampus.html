Nobody is entirely certain.</p><p>But most people believe that Krampus originally hails from the Alpine region’s pagan past. His name comes from the German word&nbsp;krampen, which means “claw,” and he bears a striking resemblance to the old Norse legends about the son of Hel, the god of the underworld.</p><p>It’s a compelling theory, especially since Krampus’ appearance coincides with a number of pagan winter rites, most notably one that sends people parading through the streets to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disperse the ghosts of winter</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194821 alt=Anti-Santa width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/krampus-devil.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194821 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>In some depictions of Krampus, he resembles the Christian Devil.</span></p><p>Over the years, as Christianity gained popularity in the region, aspects of Krampus’ appearance began to shift to fall in line with Christian beliefs.</p><p>The chains, for example, were not originally a feature of Hel’s ghoulish son. It’s believed that Christians added them to evoke the binding of the Devil. And that wasn’t the only change they made. Under Christian hands, Krampus took on a number of more devilish qualities, like the basket that he uses to carry wicked children to Hell.</p><p>From there, it isn’t hard to see how Krampus, already associated with the winter festivities, might then have been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">incorporated into Christian traditions</a> and the legend of Saint Nicholas around Christmastime.</p><h2>The Modern Krampus And Krampusnacht Celebrations</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-308773 alt="Krampus And Saint Nick" width=600 height=809 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/krampus-and-saint-nick.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-308773 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An illustration of Krampus and Saint Nicholas from the early 20th century.</span></p><p>Today, Krampus has his own celebration on the day before the Feast of Saint Nicholas in the Alpine region.</p><p>Every evening on December 5th, a night called “Krampusnacht,” elegantly dressed Saint Nicks pair up with monstrously outfitted Krampuses and make the rounds to homes and businesses, offering gifts and playful threats.

And the swats aren’t exactly gentle. But luckily, they’re usually confined to the legs, and the festive atmosphere often makes up for the occasional welt.</p><p>The tradition has become an important one in many countries and has come to include expensive handmade masks, elaborate costumes, and even parades. Though some complain that the celebration is becoming too commercialized, many aspects of the old festival endure.</p><p>Krampus masks, for example, are typically carved from wood — and they are the products of significant labor. And artisans often work for months on the costumes, which sometimes end up on display in museums as examples of a living tradition of folk art.</p><h2>The Perseverance Of A Frightening Christmas Legend</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194813 alt="Krampusnacht Celebration" width=640 height=496 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/krampus-costumes.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194813 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Franz Edelmann/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Costumed Krampuses pose for the camera at a Krampusnacht celebration in 2006.</span></p><p>It’s always remarkable when ancient traditions make it to the present — but Krampus has had an especially rough fight for survival.</p><p>In Austria in 1923, Krampus and all Krampusnacht activities were banned by the Fascist Christian Social Party. Their motives were a little murky. Though they agreed that Krampus was a force for evil, there seems to have been some confusion about whether that was because of his clear ties to the Christian Devil or his less-clear ties to the Social Democrats.</p><p>Either way, they were sure that Krampus wasn’t good for kids, and they passed out pamphlets titled “Krampus is an Evil Man,” warning parents against influencing young children with threats of a violent holiday intruder.</p><p>Though they may have had a point about the traumatic effects of telling misbehaving children that they were going to be eaten by Saint Nick’s evil twin, society wasn’t deeply moved. The ban lasted for only about four years, and vague murmurs of disapproval continued only a little while longer. But in the end, no one could keep Krampus down.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-308776 alt="Krampus With A Child" width=600 height=936 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/krampus-with-a-child.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-308776 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An illustration of Krampus with a child. 1911.</span></p><p>By the end of the 20th century, Krampus was back in full force — and in recent years, he’s made the leap across the pond to the United States. He’s had cameos on many TV shows, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimm</a>,&nbsp;Supernatural, and The Colbert Report, to name a few.</p><p>Some American cities, like Los Angeles, host annual Krampus celebrations that feature costume contests, parades, traditional dances, bell-ringing, and Alpine horn blowing.
