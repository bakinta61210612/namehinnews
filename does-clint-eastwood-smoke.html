Instead, he has inaugurated the habit of taking long walks and taking a sport, such as golf.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>His healthy routine includes a nutritious diet because he does not glut after food. Clint’s son, Scott, has also commented about the<a href=# rel=noopener> “Eastwood Code,”</a> saying that his father is an engine for exercise and healthy diet.&nbsp;</p><p>Another witness of Clint’s healthy living is his doctor, Harry Demopoulos, who confirms that Eastwood<a href=# rel=noopener> doesn’t consume fatty food</a> and tries to get a lot of good rest, and takes a regular dose of antioxidants.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Clint Eastwood’s Life As An Actor</h2><p>Clint Eastwood is many things — he is a famous American film director, TV producer, composer, politician, investor, businessman, and especially, an actor. He also served as the mayor of the small California town Carmel-by-the-sea in 1986.</p><p>Clint was born on May 31, 1930, in San Francisco, California. He is currently 92. His parents are Ruth Eastwood and Clinton Sr. The young Clint Eastwood was born with the name “Clinton Eastwood Jr.” He has a younger sibling named Jeanne.</p><p>During the Great Depression, Clinton Sr. had to move his family often until 1940, when they finally settled in Piedmont, California. To help his family survive, Clint had to work various jobs when he was younger.&nbsp;</p><p>Clint Eastwood Jr. later<a href=#> got recruited and joined the army as a lifeguard during the Korean war</a>. After serving, he left the military in 1953 and tried his luck in Hollywood as an aspiring actor. Eventually, he screened into Universal Studios, earning him a forty-week contract.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor began his career and appeared in numerous TV series but attained greater fame and popularity after appearing as Rowdy Yates in Rawhide, a well-known American series that aired until 1965.&nbsp;</p><p>A natural and dedicated actor, Clint Eastwood eventually learned to master his craft, appearing in about 11 movies in the 1950s alone.</p><p>Even the 1960s wasn’t holding back on Clint, as he still featured in 8 movies. Some of these include A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), The Witches (1967), and Paint Your Wagon (1969). In 1966, he also starred in the movie, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.&nbsp;</p><p>Clint became a giant movie star in the 70s, as he featured in about 16 more hit movies. In the 80s, he appeared in about 11 blockbuster films.</p><p>He continued to feature in hit movies even in the 2000s, and these movies obtained him awards and nominations. Some of the movies he was nominated for comprised of Mystic River (2003), Letters from Iwojima (2006), and American Sniper (2014). He won the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1995, an Academy Award for Best Directing in 2005, and many more awards and recognitions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Eastwood has won<a href=#> four Oscar awards</a> and had about 174 movie nominations in total.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Clint Eastwood’s Personal Life</h2><p>In 1953, Clint met his first wife, Maggie Johnson, on a blind date. The following year, he had a child, Laurie, who was the<a href=#> product of an affair</a>.</p><p>Laurie was later on<a href=#> adopted by Helen and Clyde Warren</a> of Seattle. Even though the child’s mother isn’t known to the public, a Patrick Mcgilligan, a biographer, says that she was a<a href=# rel=noopener> part of a theatre group in Seattle</a> that Clint had joined.</p><p><a href=#>Clint Eastwood had another secret romance while still married to Maggie Johnson</a>. This affair also produced another child, Kimber, born in 1964.&nbsp;</p><p>Clint and Maggie had two children together: Kyle, born in 1968, and Alison, 1972.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><a href=#>Eastwood has a total of eight children</a>, including Kyle, Alison, Kimber, Laurie, Kathryn, Scott, Francesca, and Morgan Eastwood.
