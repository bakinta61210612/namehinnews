LeBron “Bronny” James Jr, the eldest son of the legendary three-time NBA champion<a href=#> LeBron James,</a> knows this all too well. James Jr. currently plays as a guard for California’s Sierra Canyon High School and though he is only a 15-year-old freshman, he is a skilled and talented basketball player in his own right. Bronny has no shortage of potential and even <a href=#>drew the attention</a> of five-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, who said that Bronny could be “just as good as his dad or a little better.” Here are five questions and answers about Bronny James.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3nrJ0lBPPX/</p><p>1. How tall is Bronny James?</p><p>Bronny’s height and weight are listed at 6’4″ and 176 pounds. Though Bronny is not as tall as his 6’9″, 250 pound physical beast of a dad, his size is good for his age and position. In any case, Bronny is still growing, so he may end up reaching between 6’6″ and 6’8″ when he reaches adulthood.</p><p>2. What is Bronny James’ ranking?</p><p>According to a <a href=#>list of the Top 50 players of the Class of 2023 by Nothing But Net Magazine</a>, Bronny James is ranked no. 15. However, rankings are a bit subjective, as Bronny was also ranked <a href=#>25th on Coast2Coast Prep’s high school senior Class of 2023 list in 2018</a>, not as high as his father would have liked.</p><p>3. Does Bronny James shoot better than his father?</p><p>He does, according to LeBron James himself. In 2019, ESPN National Recruiting Director <a href=#>Paul Biancardi said on Twitter</a> that Bronny’s jump shot was better than his dad’s. <a href=#>LeBron James agreed with him</a>, saying that both Bronny and his second son Bryce Maximus have better jump shots than him.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3TDs5DBByL/</p><p>4. Has Bronny James received any college scholarship offers?</p><p>Bronny has received scholarship offers and has drawn interest from many schools. In January 2020,<a href=#> North Carolina Central University (NCCU) offered James Jr. a scholarship</a>. More recently, James Jr. received an offer from Kentucky, with Duke, Kansas, North Carolina and UCLA all showing interest, <a href=#>as reported by 247sports</a>. In fact, Bronny has been receiving college letters and scholarship offers since he was 10-years-old, <a href=#>which drew the ire of his famous father</a>, who said: “It should be a violation. You shouldn’t be recruiting 10-year-old kids.”</p><p>5. Why doesn’t Bronny James wear his father’s number?</p><p>Bronny currently wears no. 0 as a member of Sierra Canyon. LeBron James mentioned in a <a href=#>2015 Sports Illustrated interview</a> that Bronny refuses to wear his numbers (no. 23 or no. 6 as a Miami Heat player) because “he doesn’t want people to know who he is.” Considering the fact that his name is literally LeBron James Jr, going incognito may be a bit difficult for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWlmaWxfZYZwrtGopaexXZ%2BurrHSZp%2BeoZedwW7DxKKeoaxdlrSmedCunKysmaS7tHnAp6qwnaKasXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bruna-mariani.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bruna Mariani Age | Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./broncos-interview-packers-nathaniel-hackett-in-search-for-teams-next-coach.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Broncos interview Packers' Nathaniel Hackett in search for team's next coach</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
