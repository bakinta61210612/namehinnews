For instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye accused Kris of avoiding his phone calls</a> and also said her and “calmye” weren’t allowed to be around his kids.</p><p>Regarding Kim, Kanye said it was clear to everyone that the notorious movie, Get Out, was about him. Furthermore, the rapper delivered a speech in which he claimed he and Kim <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">considered aborting their first daughter together, North.</a></p><p>Since then, many of the rapper’s friends and cohorts in the music business have reached out to him, including <a href=# class=um-autolink title="Dame Dash Says He’s Still ‘Salty’ Over Jay-Z Supposedly ‘Doing Him Dirty’">Dame Dash</a>. Hot New Hip Hop says the music mogul went to Wyoming earlier this week to hang out with the rapper.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CC9VumJplIi/</p><p>Last night, the performing artist also insinuated Kim had cheated on him with Meek Mill back in 2018. Meek Mill and Kim Kardashian share one of the same passions, prison reform, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he insinuated they slept together during an event two years ago.</a></p><p>As it was noted above, a few of the rapper’s friends have gone to visit him, including his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">close friend, Dave Chappelle.</a> Dame Dash shared a picture of himself hanging around the Ye artist as well. He wrote in the caption, “We good.”</p><p>Fans of the pair know they have a history together that goes many years into the past. Initially, the reports surrounding Kanye were mixed, with many arguing his media-headline grabbing behavior was a marketing campaign for a new record.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>However, reports then went on to change in tonality. Now, there seems to be concern about the rapper’s mental health, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">especially after Kim Kardashian addressed it on her account.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUlrqmecOaqqFlp5q7tXnTqGSvoaOewW63wKewnmWnmsC1ecinZLCxn6K2r7OMmqSinF2ptaZ50ZqnqZ2iqHq0wc%2BppqydlGKvs7HApJuor55igXKFk2xsaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./davalou-stegall-obituary-1946-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Davalou Stegall Obituary (1946 - 2022)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-lane-announces-fill-them-boots-tour.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Lane Announces Fill Them Boots Tour!
