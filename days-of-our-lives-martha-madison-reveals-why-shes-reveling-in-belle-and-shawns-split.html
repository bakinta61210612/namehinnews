When asked about stepping into the shoes of other actors who’ve previously played Belle, the actress said she was thrust into the role so quickly that she didn’t have time to think about it.</p><p dir=ltr>She discussed Belle’s growth as a character with now “maybe a little more seriousness to her.” When asked if she ever thought the show would break up Belle and Shawn, she said “no” because both characters were children of two supercouples, making them “almost this soap royalty couple.” But because both characters are recast, the show and fans were open to pairing them with other people.</p><p dir=ltr>She continued, explaining that a producer once told her that “the kiss of death in this business is being happy in a couple,” and that she should want them to keep changing things up. While she likes the couple and working with Brandon Beemer, she stated “I think for us to have continued stories when these shows go on for decades and decades, you have to be willing to try new things.” When the producers and writers start saying that they don’t want to mess with Shawn and Bell, “It really leaves us nowhere to go as actors.”</p><p dir=ltr>As “Days of Our Lives” continues to shake things up and keep stories interesting, Madison will continue to give it her all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonJGuwG67xWamrqpdoba3sdJmpJqqpJ2ubrnAnaCsp55iv6bCxJqjrGWnncZuv8eeqmaqlauyrbXNoGSipl2Xsq24xGaYp5xdqLWiw82sZKyonJ7BcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./devon-sproule.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Devon Sproule - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-mark-bulley-headline-nyc-show.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Mark Bulley announces headline New York show</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
