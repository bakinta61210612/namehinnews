One of the key factors is his incredible wingspan, which is 7-foot-5, six inches longer than his height of 6-foot-10.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kevin-Durants-Wingspan.png><h2><span id=What_is_Wingspan_and_Why_Does_It_Matter>What is Wingspan and Why Does It Matter?</span></h2><p>Wingspan is the distance between the tips of a person’s fingers when they stretch their arms out to the sides.</p><p>It is usually similar to a person’s height, but some people have a disproportionate wingspan that gives them an advantage in certain sports, especially basketball.</p><p>A longer wingspan allows a player to reach higher, cover more space, and disrupt opponents more easily.</p><p>It also helps with shooting, rebounding, passing, and defending.</p><p>For example, Durant can shoot over taller defenders, grab rebounds out of their reach, pass around them, and block or steal their shots.</p><h2><span id=Kevin_Durant_has_freakish_wingspan>Kevin Durant has freakish wingspan</span></h2><p>Measuring 6 feet 10 inches, Kevin Durant, the forward for the Brooklyn Nets, doesn’t rank among the NBA’s top 50 tallest players.</p><p>Surprisingly, his wingspan spans 7 feet 5 inches, placing him in the top 30 for this attribute.</p><p>Durant boasts an unusual height-to-wingspan ratio, which contributes to his prowess as one of the finest scorers in the game.</p><p>As a two-time champion, he excels as an elite scorer across all three levels and holds his own as a capable defender.</p><p>In many ways, Durant embodies the qualities of a shooting guard confined within the body of a center, making him a perfect fit for the positionless era of basketball.</p><p>His versatile offensive repertoire enables him to easily dominate opponents.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cer8amkFvQd/</p><p>This four-time scoring champion is undeniably a physical anomaly.</p><p>Despite his towering height, he exhibits remarkable speed on the court and poses a significant threat on fastbreaks.</p><p>Interestingly, despite his impressive height and wingspan, <a href=#>Kevin Durant has difficulty palming a basketball.</a></p><p>He <a href=#>disclosed this peculiar fact during his tenure with the OKC Thunder</a>, stating, “To be honest, I don’t know why this is a story, but yeah, I can’t palm a ball.”</p><p>Durant was capable of palming balls during his college and high school days, but he asserts that they were not fully inflated.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Durant is not the sole legendary player who struggled to palm an NBA-sized ball, as other greats like Charles Barkley faced similar challenges.</p><h2><span id=How_Does_Durant_Compare_to_Other_NBA_Stars>How Does Durant Compare to Other NBA Stars?</span></h2><p>Durant’s wingspan is not the longest in the NBA, but it is among the top 30.</p><p>Some of the players who have a longer wingspan than him are Rudy Gobert (7-foot-9), Giannis Antetokounmpo (7-foot-3), and Kawhi Leonard (7-foot-3).</p><p>However, Durant has a better shooting touch and versatility than most of them, which makes him more lethal on offense.</p><p>On the other hand, some of the players who have a shorter wingspan than Durant are LeBron James (7-foot-0), <a href=#>Stephen Curry</a> (6-foot-3), and James Harden (6-foot-10).</p><p>These players are also very skilled and talented, but they may struggle more against Durant’s length and reach on defense.</p><h3><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h3><p>Kevin Durant’s wingspan is one of his greatest assets as a basketball player.</p><p>It gives him an edge over his opponents in many aspects of the game.</p><p>He is able to use his long arms to score, rebound, pass, and defend at a high level.</p><p>He is also able to adapt to different positions and roles on the court, making him a versatile and valuable player for any team.</p><p class=postsid
