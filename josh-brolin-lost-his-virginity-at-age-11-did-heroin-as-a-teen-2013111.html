"I stole a lot of radios from cars," the actor recalls. "I could pop the detail with a coat hanger real easy. I got very good at it. I can still do it today." Josh sold the stolen car parts to buy "drums and drugs," he explains. "What else was there?"</p><p>"I was the last [gang member] to get into heroin — I smoked it — and the first to get out. I was around 16 or 17, so it was around the time of The Goonies," Josh reveals. "But I liked working and learning, so it was very difficult for me to lend myself to that drug completely."</p><p>Josh — who lost his virginity at age 11 to a girl named Greta — says he became an "intimidator" and a "goon" as the years went on.</p><p>"When I was 19 a fight broke out, and when the police came, I fought the police. I was pretty drunk. To this day, I have no idea what the fight was about. I woke up in jail. The police were very angry with me. Very angry. They kicked my ass really well. I was looking at a long time in prison. So, basically, I put everything I had — everything I had earned from a TV series I did — into lawyers," <strong>Diane</strong> <strong>Lane</strong>'s husband tells the magazine. "I did a bit of jail time. Not much, but a little bit."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Josh hasn't been able to completely change his wild ways. He was was arrested for public intoxication on Jan. 1, 2013, in Santa Monica, Calif. He called the incident "<a href=#>a pretty innocent thing</a>" and mocked his mugshot.</p><p>In 2008, the actor was one of seven W. actors and crew members arrested for an altercation at the tray Cat Bar in Shreveport, La. The charges were later dropped. Four years earlier, Lane, 47, called the police on her husband, and Josh was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of domestic battery. She later declined to press charges.</p><p>For more from Josh's tell-all interview, pick up the February issue of <a href=#>Men's Journal</a>, out now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGoq5hir7O7y6KlZqSfqMFutMisZK%2Bhopy2r7XTsmSarF2WtKZ5kGpknaGUYrWmvs6ipWaZo2KubsDEnqVmamBmgHJ9kA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-bieber-defends-kylie-jenner-after-cornrows-pic-not-racist-2015147.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Bieber Defends Kylie Jenner After Cornrows Pic: Not Racist</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jojo-zarur-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jojo Zarur Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
