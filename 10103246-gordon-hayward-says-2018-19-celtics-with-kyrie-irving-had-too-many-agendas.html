"Kyrie was hurt the year before, didn't miss the playoffs. So he's trying to prove this is still his team. Then you've got (Jayson Tatum) and Jaylen (Brown) and Terry (Rozier) coming off where they're all starting, make it to the Eastern Conference Finals a year before. They're all trying to prove, like, 'We've arrived.'"</p><p>Aside from personal goals, Hayward also thinks having a roster with so much talent got in the way. With several capable scoring options playing in similar positions, it made it difficult for the Celtics to distribute the scoring evenly.</p><p>"We had probably eight players who had career highs over 40, who were all arguably in their prime," Hayward said. "The other problem is there were too many of us in the exact same position. We all needed the ball, we all rocked with the ball, we all needed the ball."</p><p>Despite coming up short in the playoffs, the Celtics put together a solid 49-33 season behind the duo of Hayward and Irving. That year was Irving's final year in Boston, though, as he left for the Brooklyn Nets that summer.</p><p>Now several years removed from the 2018-19 team, the Celtics are finding success behind the guidance of Tatum and Brown, and they're looking to accomplish what they couldn't do a few seasons ago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGh%2FdYKMoKarnJ%2Bjeqmt2LCYq5xdqK66v4xrZ2pwXWaGbq%2FEpauim6NixKrAx2aisqqZmnqqvtWipaBlmJaxbsDOqGSmmZ6ueqKzxKebmqs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-an-unknown-rachel-zegler-became-the-award-winning-maria-in-west-side-story-remake.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How an unknown Rachel Zegler became the award-winning Maria in West Side Story remake</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gooey-black-paving-material-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gooey black paving material</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
