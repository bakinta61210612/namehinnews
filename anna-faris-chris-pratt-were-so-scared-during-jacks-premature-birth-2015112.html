The Mom actress opened up about going into labor nine weeks early in the March 2015 issue of <a href=#>Redbook.</a></p><p>“My water broke in the middle of the night at seven months. We rushed to the hospital, and they were able to halt active labor with magnesium,” she explained. Doctors told the star that she would have to be in bed for four weeks, but on the seventh day, she went into labor again.</p><p>“I was in denial,” Faris, 38, told the mag. “For hours I was like, ‘I’m just having indigestion.’ Chris and I were so scared, but then Jack came out, even though he was so tiny, he looked so good to us.”</p><p>The couple’s son arrived in August 2012 and weighed in at <a href=#>just three pounds.</a> Pratt revealed to GQ magazine in November 2014 that doctors said they needed “‘to be prepared for raising a special-needs child.'” Despite the upsetting obstacle, the situation brought the two that much closer.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“It’s one of those things that drives you apart or makes you closer,” Faris explained. “I think that being a father is very meaningful and rewarding to Chris. He’s a great dad. He’s a little more serious than he was before. It forces your hand. You really have to become an adult.”</p><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy hunk, 35, recently told <strong><a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a> </strong>that Jack is “remarkable” and <a href=#>like his “therapist.”</a> In December, he gave an emotional speech about his tyke during the March of Dimes Celebration of Babies Hollywood Luncheon. <a href=#>He noted that Jack</a> was brought to the neonatal intensive care unit following his birth, was hooked up to an IV, and finally went home when he reached 4 lbs., and 5 oz.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Our Jack went from a small helpless little squirt to a strong, happy, funny, and vocal boy,” Pratt said at the time. “He loves monster trucks and Daniel Tiger and, believe it or not, he loves vegetables. Broccoli and cherry tomatoes are his favorite foods.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But are they Faris’ go-to snacks? The actress joked to Redbook that the couple’s kitchen was basically empty when Pratt had to lose 65 pounds for his Guardians of the Galaxy role.</p><p>“I just remember being grumpy because there was no food in the house. I love to cook really fattening things like steak and pasta and potatoes. I bake banana bread,” she said. She may have been running on an empty stomach, but Faris did love the eye candy. “But it’s okay,” she added. “I love Chris ripped and I love him a little rounder, too.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaJinppFis6K%2ByKxknKCinsBuvNGaq61lp5q%2FpnnSqGSsm5GnsqV5w66poqaXYreir8qsZKmqlaKutcHRnmSboaKptW5%2Bj2psamli</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bad-neighborhood-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bad neighborhood</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andre-muniz-breaks-ronaldo-jacare-souzas-arm-to-score-win-by-submission-at-ufc-262.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Andre Muniz breaks Ronaldo Jacare Souzas arm to score win by submission at UFC 262</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
