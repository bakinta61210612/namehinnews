While throwing a going-away party at her Malibu home last weekend, a group of girls snuck into the reality star's bedroom and stole bikinis, purses and pictures, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports. The alleged thieves unloaded their loot in the street after being spotted by a fellow partygoer. A valet driver found Hilton's belongings and turned them in to the cops; no police report was filed.</p><p>"I have bad luck when it comes to thieves," Hilton, 32, <a href=#>tweeted</a> on Sunday, Aug. 4. "They tried to steal my new collection of Paris Hilton purses from my Malibu house." Hilton's driver retrieved her property, TMZ reports. The girls' identities are not yet known.</p><p>This marks the seventh known time that Hilton's Malibu home has been burglarized. From 2008 to 2009, a group of teens known as "the bling ring" allegedly stole more than $2 million worth of jewelry from the star, in addition to a number of designer outfits. One member even tried to dognap one of Hilton's many pets. Their alleged crimes were chronicled in director <strong>Sofia Coppola</strong>'s June 2013 movie, The Bling Ring. (Hilton made a cameo and even let the filmmaker shoot inside her home.)</p><p>Despite enduring numerous break-ins, Hilton told <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a> in June 2013 that she has no intention of ever putting her Malibu mansion on the market. "When it first happened, I'd already had so many other experiences at other houses I've lived at in the Hollywood Hills with stalkers, people climbing my gates, and tour buses full of people driving by. I've always been used to this," she explained. "But living in a gated community is the safest place you could live in L.A. Even though it happened to me and it's scary, I just had to up the security in and around my house with cameras, laser beams and the most high-tech system."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hilton added, "In my gated community, nobody used to even lock their doors because there are guards there, and it's a gated community. I don't even think there was a burglary there until this happened. My housekeeper had been there and left the key under the mat for me, so they took the key, made a copy of it, and brought it back. The kids basically had their own copy of the key and broke into my home, like, six times."</p><p>To her dismay, the "Stars Are Blind Singer" never recovered the majority of her jewelry. "Anything of value, every single Rolex, diamond earring, or anything else, they had sold," she told <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a>. "I just got back a bunch of things that weren't that important to me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKeaqpmoeqm1y62mp6tdnby2v8Rmqaiakpqxbq3GmqCnZWJlfnSBlw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./phil-mickelson-came-to-light-after-his-controversial-comments-about-a-new-saudi-golf-league.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Phil Mickelson Came To Light After His Controversial Comments About A New Saudi Golf League</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./one-step-time-2-wds-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>One step ___ time: 2 wds.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
