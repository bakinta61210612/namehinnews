Luna began working in TV, movies and theatre since he was 8 and all the while was grooming himself for the bigger screens. He alternated between film and television for years before jumping to stardom in the hit 2001 film.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Luna is now the co-founder of a production house called Canana with fellow actor Gael Garcia Bernal, his best friend of several years.

The Mexican actor never got to really know his mother in person as she died in 1982 after a traffic collision that claimed her life when her son was only two. It is said that it was Fiona who made sure her son would be immersed in the film industry but after she passed; her husband further reinforced the importance of theatre and arts in Diego’s life.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite losing his mother at such a young age, Diego claims he felt close to her while he was growing up. He says he used to talk to her at night from his dreams, he knew what she looked like. The Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (2004) actor further attributed some of these experiences to his love for Star Wars as a kid, the movie franchise made him believe in the supernatural force and according to him, it made him close to his late mother.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Alejandro Luna </strong>(full name&nbsp;José Alejandro Dionisio Luna Ledesma)&nbsp;(father)</p><p><img decoding=async title="Diego Luna's dad Alejandro Luna" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Diego-Luna-family-father-Alejandro-Luna.jpg alt="Diego Luna's family - father Alejandro Luna" width=800 height=466 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> December 1, 1939</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Sagittarius</p><p style=text-align:justify>Alejandro is a famed Mexican scenic designer and lightning technician. He was already established in the industry so it was not strange when Diego became really interested in his father’s passion. Luna describes his relationship with his father as the most intense and important relationship in his life. He further adds that his father is his best friend and this beautiful father-son connection drove Diego to aspire to greatness in his career.</p><br><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Though Google says that Ivan Amozurrutia&nbsp;is Luna’s brother, we didn’t find any confirmation of this info.</strong></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Camila Sodi</strong> (former spouse)</p><p><img decoding=async title="Diego Luna's then-spouse Camila Sodi" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bodyheightweight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Diego-Luna-family-ex-wife-Camila-Sodi.jpg alt="Diego Luna's family - ex-wife Camila Sodi" width=800 height=497 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Duration of Marriage:</strong> February 5, 2008 – March 2013 (5 years)</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> May 14, 1986</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Taurus</p><p style=text-align:justify>She has been described repeatedly as one of the most gorgeous women in Mexico.

Both lovers were expecting a baby already when they tied the knot in 2008 and subsequently, they became parents to another child in 2010.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Even though Camila and the Milk (2008) actor split in 2013, the Mexican singer has nothing but love for her ex-husband. Since their divorce, she has supported him severally at premieres and they do a wonderful job at co-parenting their kids. Camila says she is able to maintain a close relationship with her former spouse because the family love they now share is greater than all.
