The anticipation was so much less that the couple would finally wed and so much more what she would look like. Since announcing their engagement, the couple became international superstars in the media and Kate’s look became the subject of almost every conversation. There is no doubt she is well dressed, beautiful and poised. She’s a huge fan of re-wearing her favorite outfits rather than wearing them once and never again. She always looks classic and perfect, even in jeans and a sweater.</p><p>There is not much this lovely royal does not miss when it comes to her fashion and sense of style, and she is just lovely because of it. Still, the most important thing Kate Middleton ever worn was her wedding dress, and it’s the type of style that women all over the world are looking to emulate. The gown, designed by Sarah Burton, the creative director for Alexander McQueen, was kept very much a secret until the Duchess exited her car on her wedding day, and then details emerged at once. The gown, beautiful and elegant and classic all the way has caused a stir in the world that does not seem to have changed even though it’s been well over four years since she donned the gown.</p><p>Even today, women everywhere want to wear her gown and that’s why so many replicas of the gown have been produced. While many have already worn gowns similar, including the $77,000 Valentino gown worn over the summer by hotel Heiress Nicky Hilton designed to look very much like Kate Middleton’s, we still think that this classic gown would look just lovely on many celebrities if they were to get married – or even do over their weddings so that they could wear the gown. Find out which stars would look the loveliest in her gown.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/458052408.jpg alt="Kate Middleton Wedding Dress: Anne Hathaway" width=640 height=427 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Anne Hathaway</h2><p>She might already been married, but she would look like a beauty queen in a dress like the one Kate Middleton wore on her wedding day. She has the most gorgeous bone structure and the most delicate features to pull off this gown in a way that would work just as well as the way the Duchess wore it. They look nothing alike, but she carries herself so elegantly that this dress would have been a wonderful choice on her wedding day.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/469867732.jpg alt="reese witherspoon" width=640 height=426 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Reese Witherspoon</h2><p>What would be more fun than Kate Middleton’s dress with a southern flair? Witherspoon is the quintessential girl next door, and we love that about her. We could see her going back in time to her wedding day with husband Jim Toth and rocking this dress in a way that was elegant and classy, perhaps with a pair of cowgirl boots beneath it for fun dancing after the ceremony ends.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/483842523.jpg alt="emma stone" width=640 height=507 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Emma Stone</h2><p>She’s a little bit edgy and a little bit of a rocker chic, but we think she could really make Kate Middleton’s wedding dress her own. Perhaps with some bold shoes and her signature red lip, she could make this look her own and really bring out her own individuality.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/461322004.jpg alt="hilary duff" width=640 height=427 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Hilary Duff</h2><p>She’s married but perhaps getting divorced. She’s said she’s been working on her marriage and yet she’s also been on a date with someone she met online according to some recent reports, so we’re not sure where she is. But since she may or may not get married again in the future, we think she’d look just gorgeous in this particular style wedding dress. It’s classic and elegant, and very much stylish like Duff.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/453464600.jpg alt="taylor swift" width=640 height=557 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Taylor Swift</h2><p>How could we not choose the gorgeous Taylor Swift to wear a dress that looks like Kate Middleton’s? She is tall, beautiful and she is elegant all the way. Known for her trendy but always on point fashion, this dress would be so flattering on her. We’d love to see what she could sing about it when she wore it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/176473247.jpg alt="eva longoria" width=640 height=443 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Eva Longoria</h2><p>The petite brunette beauty is gorgeous any day of the week, and she’s already worn one stunning dress when she married her ex-husband Tony Parker. We think that the next time around she would look like an actual princess in something more like Kate Middleton’s. The look is classic and would be wonderful for her frame, her face and even her age. She’s a little older than many of the women on the list, but she’s so beautiful and carries herself so well that this dress would be amazing.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/459341694.jpg alt="nina dobrev" width=640 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Nina Dobrev</h2><p>The former “Vampire Diaries” star is very similar to the Duchess in so many ways. She has the same long, dark hair, the same slender frame. They could be cousins or long-lost sisters. That’s why we know with certainty that she’d rock this dress in a way that maybe even the Duchess didn’t, which would be in a very sexy manner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/90991518.jpg alt="leighton meester" width=640 height=458 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Leighton Meester</h2><p>She’s pregnant and expecting her first child with her husband but if she could do her wedding day all over again, we’d love to see her in something like Kate Middleton’s wedding gown. Long and covered in lace, perfectly elegant in every way; we think that Meester is the perfect candidate for this lovely and gorgeous gown.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4909094591.jpg alt="blake lively " width=640 height=427 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Blake Lively</h2><p>Who in our culture is more fashionable, more gorgeous and more elegant than Blake Lively? No one; which is why she is our number one pick for this amazing gown worn by the Duchess. With her tall stature, her lovely face and her long blonde hair, we think that if she had time to marry Ryan Reynolds all over again, she should wear this dress. She wed in the south, and this gown screams southern belle all the way.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/454093074.jpg alt="lucy hale " width=640 height=426 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Lucy Hale</h2><p>She’s young, she’s not married and she’s a total fashion plate. That’s why we’d love to see Lucy Hale in a very Kate Middleton-like gown on her eventual wedding day. She’s to the look, the frame and the face for something with these much sophistication.</p><p>Photos by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiimqyVYrqqsMOlnK2nnmLEprDDoqWgZZSnsrS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./benjamin-cooper-joplin-mo-death-and-obituary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Benjamin Cooper Joplin MO Death and Obituary: Corporal Officer Shot By Suspect - Age &amp;amp; Family Detail</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./freak-show-members.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>9 Famous 'Freak Show' Acts And Their Stories Of Exploitation And Tragedy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
