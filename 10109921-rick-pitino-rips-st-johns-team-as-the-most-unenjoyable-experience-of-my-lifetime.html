"Our lateral quickness and our toughness is just something I've never witnessed in all my years of coaching. We are so nonathletic that we can't guard anybody without fouling."</p><p>"And really it's not about losing," he continued. "Even winning, when I watch the film, I see un-athletic plays, I see people that don't handle the ball, that are just interested in taking quick shots. It's been a disappointing year."</p><p>Pitino then ripped a number of individual players.</p><p>"Joel [Soriano]'s slow laterally, he's not fast on the court," he said. "Chris Ledlum is slow laterally, Sean Conway's slow laterally. Brady [Dunlap's] physically weak, Drissa [Traore] is slow laterally."</p><p>The tirade came after St. John's lost 68-62 against Seton Hall on Sunday, blowing a 19-point lead. The Red Storm are now just 6-9 in Big East play and are going to miss out on the NCAA tournament, barring a miraculous run through the conference tournament in March.</p><p>Pitino hastily put together a new roster after taking over as head coach last year, adding eight transfers and a pair of freshman recruits. He said he wasn't necessarily surprised that a team rebuilt on the fly was now having its struggles.</p><p>"I had no choice," he said. "We just could take who we could get, who was available, we had no choice. I don't think we were going to win the first year anyway, because when you rush like that, you don't see the players. Not a whole lot we can do."</p><p>Still, it will be interesting to see how his players respond to being lambasted publicly. Whether it's the effort and toughness of individuals on the court, finding the right lineup balance or the coaching in general, something needs to change for a St. John's team that has made it a habit of late of blowing leads.</p>Mike Vaccaro <span class=acct>@MikeVacc</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Column: as St. John's season spirals out of control, Rick Pitino resorts to an old stand-by: blaming everyone in the room with the exception of himself. It's tired and terrible look, in addition to being inaccurate. He's had as bad a year as his players. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SVew3QdSrl">https://t.co/SVew3QdSrl&lt;/a></p>WFAN Sports Radio <span class=acct>@WFAN660</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GioWFAN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GioWFAN&lt;/a> calls out Rick Pitino for "embarrassing" postgame comments: &lt;a href="https://t.co/aBOfWaEafs">pic.twitter.com/aBOfWaEafs&lt;/a></p><p>"I think the other team makes adjustments and we have to make adjustments to move the basketball and take good shots. But we just lack toughness," Pitino said. "We just don't move our feet on defense. ... It's really all the toughness things are why we give up leads."</p><p>It remains to be seen if Pitino will hold himself to the same level of accountability as he publicly did to his players.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG6Gc32Mq6Cco12ltrW1zahkq6GgqHq0wIyjpqGmo2LBpq3MZpisZaSdsm65zqyrZq2emruru9iamaWdXZrFsbHRopynm5VivKd5zLJkpaGWmsGqucQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./samuel-goldwyn.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Samuel Goldwyn Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./perfect-olympic-scores-sometimes-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Perfect Olympic scores sometimes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
