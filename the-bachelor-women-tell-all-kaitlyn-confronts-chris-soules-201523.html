The claws are out and the tears are flowing as <strong>Chris Soules’</strong>&nbsp;season 19 castoffs get real in front of <strong>Chris Harrison</strong> and a studio audience. In what Harrison calls the “most shocking season” yet (aren’t they all, though?), some women played it cool only to have their hearts broken, while others walked away reality TV villains.</p><p>For the March 2 episode, ABC brought back the original cast members except for final two Becca and Whitney — and yes, crazy Kelsey was present and accounted for. Let’s recap!</p><p><strong>The Bro-chelor</strong></p><p>We thought all the screaming would be restricted to the L.A. soundstage — but everything goes up a decibel when Chris H. and Chris S. hit up several Bachelor viewing parties. Wild moms smooch Chris S., and cowboy hat-clad Bachelor-lovers bring out whiskey shots for the visiting men. “I do think there may be a little alcohol consumption going on,” the Bachelor giggles before several women run screaming after his bus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>Frenemies</strong></p><p>L.A. waitress Britt doesn’t seem to grasp the concept that&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;isn’t usually a breeding ground for lasting friendships, and immediately confronts Carly for revealing her lying tendencies to Chris. “Why did you pretend to be my friend the whole time?” Britt questions the cruise ship singer, citing a night of slumber party-esque bonding before the pair was eliminated.</p><p>“It wasn’t about you and me. It was about Chris,” retorts Carly, as the rest of the women chime in. Jillian quickly comes to Britt’s defense as Jade calls her “duplicitous,” but the others focus on her unwillingness to move to rural Arlington. It’s clear that Britt blames her elimination completely on Carly, telling Harrison between commercial breaks: “I’m not mad at him for believing her.”</p><p>Later, Britt has the opportunity to speak to the Iowan directly, and after an awkwardly long hug she tells him she understands why he “believed Carly.”</p><p>“The reason things didn’t work out wasn’t because I believed or didn’t believe Carly… there were some things I saw and that I felt, that I realized it wasn’t right,” Chris tells her. “I would never make a decision on a relationship that we had based on what somebody else told me.” (So much for that theory, huh, Britt?)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>The “Amazing” Story, Revisited</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite much speculation that she wouldn’t show her face, season 19 villain Kelsey is present – and just as dramatic as ever. “I’m feeling betrayed,” she sniffles. “Misrepresented. I’m feeling like I’m grieving all over again.” Cue the aghast looks and snarky comments from her fellow competitors.</p><p>“What do you mean despair? You said it was an amazing story,” season 19’s drunken delight Tara says, disgusted. Regardless, Kelsey continues on her high horse. “I think there are a lot of reasons [why the women hate me],” she tells Harrison. “I’ve heard that I’m condescending, and that I use big words.”</p><p>The 27 other bachelorettes are quick to confront the vindictive guidance counselor. “She is one of the most calculated people I’ve ever met,” says fellow widower Juelia. “As someone who’s been through something also very tragic, I would have never used something that happened to me to say that I deserve love more than anyone else here.”</p><p><strong>The Girl Next Door</strong></p><p>Jade thinks Chris is a fibber, and she’s ready to confront him about it. After revealing her naked modeling past to the&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;on the hometown dates, she was unceremoniously dumped. While Chris made a point to tell her the Playboy pics didn’t affect his decision, the cosmetics developer doesn’t believe him — her nude modeling days have ruined relationships for her before.</p><p>Jade confronts Chris about being cruel toward her in a blog post, saying, “I just want an explanation because you said the person you knew and the person my family described were two different people and you found that ‘disturbing.’” Chris&nbsp;owns up to the insensitive word use, and tells her he didn’t like that he couldn’t see every facet of her personality — including what her brothers described as a “wild mustang.”</p><p><strong>Field Plowing</strong></p><p>Fan favorite and potential season 11&nbsp;Bachelorette&nbsp;Kaitlyn was sent packing in Bali after the fantasy suites — with very little explanation from our farmer. “I genuinely had no reason to think I was gone that day — that might have been the most confident I ever felt in a rose ceremony,” the dance instructor told Harrison. The goofy brunette admits to relying heavily on humor in tough situations, but said the show reminded her that she can still feel — and hurt. And she wants an explanation from the often tongue-tied Soules for causing that hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just had zero reason to believe that I was done and I don’t want you to sugar coat it,” she tells the squirming&nbsp;Bachelor. “I’m just looking for a genuine answer of what happened.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Per usual, Chris leaves something to be desired with his response. After using an unfortunate metaphor about shooting darts in the dark, he tells Kaitlyn that he “can’t really give [her] clarity” on the decision.</p><p>Harrison ends the emotional reunion by cutting to something a little more lighthearted — bloopers. And thankfully so — a montage of Soules’ dolphin giggle is all it takes to soothe all those hard feelings. We can’t wait to find out the lucky lady who gets to enjoy that laugh for the rest of her life!</p><p>Tell&nbsp;<strong>Us</strong>: Who do you think will win Chris Soules’ heart: Whitney or Becca?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOrZ%2BeZZKWsKmxy6ipZq%2BforKvedOeo6VlkaG5brfAoqulsZ5isLC6xaump6yjYrCpvsisZKynpaGytHmRaWhuamM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./treasures-b-side-single-darari-is-taking-over-the-internet-and-spotify.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TREASUREs B-Side Single DARARI Is Taking Over The Internet And Spotify</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-family-tree-father-mother-name-pictures.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Family Tree Father, Mother Name Pictures</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
