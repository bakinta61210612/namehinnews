At the time of the trade, Pham was batting .268 with 10 home runs, 36 RBIs and 11 stolen bases in 79 games.</p>Steven Cohen <span class=acct>@StevenACohen2</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>I will clear up any misperception about Tommy Pham. He was a great guy and a terrific teammate. He played his heart out as a Met</p><p>After making his MLB debut with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2014, Pham played for the Cardinals, Tampa Bay Rays and San Diego Padres during his first seven seasons in the majors.</p><p>The Diamondbacks mark Pham's fourth team in two years. Another midseason trade sent him from the Cincinnati Reds to the Boston Red Sox in 2022.</p><p>Pham signed a one-year deal with the Mets in January with the idea that he was one of a few free-agent acquisitions bolstering a title contender. He expected the team would be buying at the deadline, the outfielder told the <i>New York Post</i>'s <a href=# rel=noopener>Dan Martin</a>.</p><p>Instead, Pham quickly saw the Mets' playoff chances shrink. His reported comments took place at a dinner following a brutal three-game sweep by the Atlanta Braves, during which the Mets blew a trio of consecutive three-run leads for the first time in <a href=# rel=noopener>franchise history</a>.</p><p>Pham is now one of the players contributing to the Mets' misery. He hit a single, double and home run to lead the Diamondbacks to a 4-3 comeback victory September 12 in New York.</p><p>The Mets currently sit 8.0 games back of an NL wild card spot with 10 games remaining in the season. For Cohen, who has said he hopes to <a href=# rel=noopener>contend</a> next fall, Pham's assertion that the Mets' core is not part of their problem could serve as a spark of hope for the 2024 team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWWAdoSMraampalivamtzGarqKSUYrmqusOoqWallanAbrTAr5xmpJWWwLV5x5qpnZ2jqXq4u9GkoKefXZy%2FsMHPZqafZaCkwKrAyKilZqiclsamvtI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-basketball-players-of-all-time-2220.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 Basketball Players of All Time | Discuss</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./theres-a-lake-in-africa-that-literally-turns-animals-to-stone-1631.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>There's a Lake in Africa that Literally Turns Animals to Stone | Discuss</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
