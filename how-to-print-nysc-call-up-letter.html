Finally, scroll down to locate the Print Call-up Letter, then click on it.</strong></p><p>National Youth Service Corps has been a mandatory exercise for all university graduates from Nigeria and Nigerian citizens outside Nigeria. It doesn’t matter if one completed their tertiary education in the country or not; all that matters is to meet the criteria, of which an NYSC Call-up letter is one of the most important.</p><p>However, graduates above the age of 30 are exempted from the NYSC exercise. Still, they are required to get an exemption letter from the National Youth Service Corps secretariate resident in the State. Prospective corp members are also mandated to monitor when the NYSC Call-up letter for their batch and stream is ready as long as they participated in the online registration process.</p><h2><strong>What Is NYSC Call-Up Letter?</strong></h2><p>An NYSC call-up letter is a letter that a prospective corp member receives on completion of the online registration exercise. The call-up letter is more like a ticket to a National Youth Service Corps orientation camp. It is a document showing the State of deployment, address of a corp members orientation camp, date of opening the orientation camp for corps members, and other essential pieces of information.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/call-up.png alt width=696 height=496 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3><strong>Reason for Printing NYSC Call-Up Letter</strong></h3><p>It confirms prospective corp members claim to be signed up for the one-year NYSC exercise. Not having your call-up letter is an automatic disqualification for the National Youth Service Corps orientation camp as the graduate won’t have a place of posting. It serves as a document used for verification by NYSC officials in the orientation camp. Right from the camp’s entrance until after the camping, the Call-up letter is very important as it can be demanded at any given time.</p><h2><strong>What NYSC Call-up Letter Can Be Used For</strong></h2><p>The NYSC call-up letter serves many purposes, including the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The letter serves as a means of NYSC confirmation on registration: </strong>The NYSC call-up letter can be used to confirm that one has successfully finished the necessary registration for the NYSC orientation camping exercise and is entitled to the 21days camping.</li><li><strong>It stands as a letter of direction to the Orientation Camp: </strong>It also serves as a direction to corp members on their deployed state for camping. It also provides a direction to the orientation ground for corp members who don’t have the knowledge of the venue.</li><li><strong>Serves as the first identification card of a corp member: </strong>The letter is the very first identification document given by NYSC to whom it may concern, confirming that the holder is part of the NYSC exercise and should be given every necessary support. Also, it is the first identification letter for all prospective corps members. NYSC corp members are advised to have copies of the call-up letter, as it will be demanded right from the entrance of the mobilization camp.</li><li><strong>It stands as a means of verification document in the camp: </strong>The document is used as a verification document in the camp by NYSC officials during the 21 days camping exercise. All corp members are mandated to submit copies of the call-up letter to the verification panel set up in the camp.</li><li><strong>A means of sending prior Instructions to corp members: </strong>It is also a guide to corp members before embarking on selfless service. It contains other documents the corp members are advised to come to the camp with to avoid extra expenses in making them available in the camp.</li><li><strong>Serves as a guide to corp members kits specifications: </strong>The letter contains towards the end a guide to NYSC officials on the kit size of corp members for easy and proper distribution in the orientation ground.</li></ul><h2><strong>How Do I Check My NYSC Portal Call-Up Letter?</strong></h2><p>It usually takes up to three weeks to get your NYSC call-up letter online after you’ve duly registered.
