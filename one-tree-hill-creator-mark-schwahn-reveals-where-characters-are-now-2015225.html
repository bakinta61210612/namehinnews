One Tree Hill<strong> </strong>creator <strong>Mark Schwahn</strong>, and stars <strong>James Laffery</strong> and <strong>Bryan Greenberg</strong> kept their bromance going as they attended Greenberg’s 4th annual Olevolos Project benefit brunch in NYC on Saturday, May 16. At the star-studded bash, the guys relived their Tree Hill days, teased a possible reunion, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The CW teen drama ran for nine seasons from 2003 to 2012. Greenberg’s hunky Jake Jagielski moved away with his daughter Jenny while former fling Peyton Sawyer (<strong>Hilarie Burton</strong>) went on to marry Lucas Scott (<a href=#><strong>Chad Michael Murray</strong></a>). But according to Schwahn, the Karen’s Cafe performer would have made Peyton just as happy. Sorry, Leyton fans!</p><p>“I think they would have been very happy. They were a very soulful couple. They were a couple of artists. And they had great chemistry too—Bryan and Hilarie had great chemistry,” Schwahn, 48, told <a href=#>Glamour</a> magazine. “She would have been completely happy. She chose an artist and she chose a writer, but not everybody’s gonna choose the musician, come on!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Greenberg, 36, quipped: “Jake Jagielski is on the run, I always feel like. With his six- string! He’s, like, in Mexico. I see him with a really long beard.”</p><p>Jagielski’s Ravens basketball teammate Nathan Scott, meanwhile, would still be with his “always and forever” wife Haley James (<strong>Bethany Joy Lenz</strong>). “They live overseas. Nathan was becoming a [sports] agent, so I think they travel a lot. I think the family is happy and he balances home and work,” Schwahn explained, undoubtedly reassuring Naley fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Nathan Scott was that guy who was such a wild maverick in the beginning, but it’s the oldest story in the world: The bad boy changes his behavior for the love of a good woman,” he continued. “I think Nathan found Haley, and he was still a bad boy in defense of her, but he’s become a good father, maybe the father he never had. He’s got great kids, she’s a great mom, and it’s the American dream.”</p><p>Nathan and Haley’s son Jamie, of course, is all grown up now too. “16 kids. They’re just popping ’em out,” Lafferty, 29, joked. “Jamie’s probably got a sitcom somewhere, and he’s going to be richer than all of us someday!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The longtime pals have reunited over the years, and still are close. An official OTH reunion, however, is still up in the air. “This is the mastermind, you have to talk to him,” Greenberg said of Schwahn. “Never say never! I never say never.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Schwahn, who is busy with his new E! series The Royals, added: “This is what I love—everybody always pins it on me! They love to pin it on me, but here’s the truth: The cast has been very successful, and if you look around, they’re all doing great things, which I’m incredibly proud of. Get ‘em all in one place, and I’ll be there!”</p><p>Hear that Tree Hill lovers?
