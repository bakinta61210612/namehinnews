Khloé then dated French Montana, a famous rapper; their relationship was relatively brief but still garnered significant media attention.</p><p>It was her relationship with NBA player Tristan Thompson that garnered the most attention; it has had its ups and downs, including allegations of infidelity and several temporary break-ups.
