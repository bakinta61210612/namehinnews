The cast of 2004 classic Mean Girls&nbsp;&nbsp;—&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Tina Fey</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Rachel McAdams</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Amanda Seyfried</a></strong>, and <strong>Lacey Chabert&nbsp;</strong>—&nbsp;<a href=#>reunited recently</a> for Entertainment Weekly‘s Reunion Issue, and naturally, they spilled amazing tidbits from the set <a href=#>in an interview</a> published Wednesday, Nov. 5.</p><p>“It was terrifying. I don’t know what I would have done without Lacey Chabert,” Seyfried, 28, recalled of being a newcomer in Hollywood at the time. “She was my angel. She took me in, and we’d hang out in her trailer and listen to Dido… Lacey taught me how to make pecan pie. She made my experience so magical and so safe for me.”</p><p>While those two got along great, Fey recalled to the magazine that the film’s megastar (Lohan) was feuding with a fellow Disney darling at the time. “I remember 17-year-old Lindsay was on a mission to find pink Uggs. That was, like, what she was working on,” the comedienne told EW. “And there was one day where she tried to explain to <a href=#><strong>Amy </strong>[<strong>Poehler</strong></a>] and me her beef with <strong><a href=#>Hilary Duff</a></strong>, but we couldn’t crack it. But we were pretending we could follow it.”</p><p>Lohan described her approach to acting at the time as “somewhat Method.” She elaborated: “I had been online trying to get pink Uggs because I had a pink pleated skirt in the scene where I fall into the garbage can,” she told the mag. “I was like, ‘I need pink Uggs!’ I mean, I was rhinestoning my phone at the time with Swarovski crystals.”</p><p>It turns out she also feuded with director <strong>Mark Waters </strong>after landing the role of Cady Heron as opposed to Regina George. “I had finished Freaky Friday with Mark Waters not long before… and I was doing Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,” she said, revealing that she was solicited to star in the flick. “I wanted to play Regina. I had just played—in Confessions and Freaky—not the cool girl in school. I was still 17 years old and I wanted to be the cool girl on set. So I had a war with him, and he goes, ‘No, Cady is the heroine, and that’s who you are.'”</p><p>McAdams, meanwhile, said she <a href=#>wanted to originally play Cady</a>. “Everyone was flipped around a little bit,” <a href=#>the Notebook actress</a> told EW. “I loved Regina—she seemed so deliciously wicked and borderline evil. I was quite a bit older at the time—I was, like, 24 or 25. Mark said, ‘I see Cady a little bit younger, but I think it makes sense if Regina kind of grew up a little too fast.'”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=355 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Santa Claus Mean Girls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Even Fey second-guessed which girl belonged in which role. “At some point I was like, ‘Oh, should Lindsay be Regina?'” she recalled. “And then Mark and <strong>Lorne [Michaels]</strong> had the good sense to say, ‘No, she gets to turn into Regina.’ You work backward from that and you cast her as Cady, knowing she could get to that point of being Regina, but you let her be the innocent side, too.”</p><p>Despite losing out on the coveted role, Lohan said there was no bad blood between any of the girls. “I sat in all the auditions,” she said. “Amanda auditioned to play Regina as well. It ended up being Rachel, and she’s wonderful.”</p><p>With their widespread success, Fey added that she looks back and regrets not signing on for a sequel. “At the time we did want to start the conversation about the sequel, and for whatever reason I was like, ‘No!!! We shouldn’t do that!'” she told EW. “Now I look back and I’m like, ‘Why?’ But now, no—it’s too late now.” Her fellow costars also reflected on the film’s legacy in pop culture.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=623 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="EW cover Mean Girls" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“<strong><a href=#>Mariah Carey</a></strong> and I have the same makeup artist,” Lohan shared. “Whenever I see her, she does always say, ‘On Wednesdays, I wear pink.’ She loves that movie.” Along with giving a shout-out to the Elusive Chanteuse, Lohan also showed love to her pal <strong><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a></strong> while speculating about Cady Heron’s future. “Cady’s with Oprah in Africa working at children’s schools with a family, teaching girls to be nice to each other,” Lohan said of her character. (The actress recently starred in a reality docu-series for the media mogul’s network.)</p><p>McAdams hilariously commented on her character’s future, saying Regina would most likely be a Real Housewife. “She’d have too much time on her hands, for sure,” the Canadian star told the mag. “She’s probably found all her other Reginas.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOppyapl2ctrO40mapnq2enryvecuipZ2rka56rbvHmqVmqpGYtaa4jKaampyRosBuv8StZKydk6eytb%2BMq5yvnZGhsqV5kWlobW1hZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./155683-national-shutdown-carl-niehaus-sparks-debate-comparing-deployment-saps-sandf-1976-uprising.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>National Shutdown: Carl Niehaus Sparks Controversy After Claiming SAPS and SANDF Are Unhappy About D</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lake-bell.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lake Bell Wiki, Age, Husband, Net Worth, Ethnicity, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
