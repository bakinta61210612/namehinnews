Both were unaware of Kekua’s condition until she was involved in a serious car accident her sophomore year, and testing during her recuperation period in the hospital spotted cancerous cells in her blood.</p><p>Devastated but not destroyed, Te’o drew on the strength and courage Kekua had shown in her final months and continued to play on through his period of mourning—keeping his final promise to her and taking the field against Michigan on September 22, the day of Kekua’s funeral. Te’o <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a>:</p><p>I knew when they were going to close the casket,&nbsp;It was during walkthrough. I remember I asked Coach [Bob]&nbsp;Diaco, "Coach, what time is it?" And he said "It’s 12:01."</p><p>That would be 9:01 California time, and nine o’clock is when they closed the casket for my girlfriend. So I had a moment then.</p><p>Te’o would go on to make eight tackles and snag two interceptions against the Wolverines in front of a crowd of Notre Dame fans, many of whom wore Hawaiian leis in support of their star player whose whole life had been turned upside down in the past week.</p><p>Te’o “sent” his two interceptions to Kekua, along with a single bouquet of white flowers he had placed on her grave.</p><p>Te’o’s continued excellence at linebacker this season established him as a Heisman frontrunner and helped elevate Notre Dame’s football team to a 12-0 record and the No. 1 ranking in the land.</p><p>Tonight Te’o and the Fighting Irish look to extend that record to a perfect 13-0 and beat the Alabama Crimson Tide for the program’s first national title since 1988.</p><p>Win or lose, I think we all know Lennay Kekua will be smiling down on the Irish tonight, and Te’o will do his very best to honor her for his last time in the blue and gold of Notre Dame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG1vZGmCennRnqSepZKav6q6xmajnqaelsZut8SkrJplkpqzsL7EZquhnV2XtqizxKyrZp%2BRorJuu8VmpJqmpJ56tbHOrGSloZaa</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./right-now-to-surgeons-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Right now to surgeons</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mistresses-season-finale-recap-find-out-who-murdered-luca-raines-201549.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mistresses Season Finale Recap: Find Out Who Murdered Luca Raines</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
