The American actress, known for starring as Wednesday Addams in Netflix’s Wednesday, has lived in the city for most of her life.</strong></p><p>Having achieved fame and fortune at quite a young age, the 21-year-old Jenna Ortega, with an estimated net worth of $3 million, purchased a home in the city in 2021. Up until 2022, she was reported to still live with her family in the house.</p><h2><strong>Jenna Ortega’s House</strong></h2><p>Jenna Ortega’s house is located in La Quinta, a desert resort city in Riverside County, California, United States. Known as a leading golf destination in the US, the city is one of the nine cities of the Coachella Valley area and is located 100 miles east of Los Angeles. According to reports, Ortega paid $826,000 in 2021 to acquire the 2,540 square feet, 4-bedroom, 4-bathroom property located in what was described as a quiet neighborhood.</p><p>The house, which is surrounded by desert mountains, features amenities like a large kitchen with stainless steel appliances and granite countertops, a family room with a fireplace and large TV, a game room with a pool table and a foosball table, and a backyard with a swimming pool, patio, and fire pit. It is no surprise that the actress went for a home with all these amenities seeing that she has a large family. She is one of the six children born to her parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jenna-Ortega-House-La-Quinta.jpg><p>Jenna Ortega is not the only popular person to have a home in La Quinta, as it is reported that many other celebrities have chosen the city known for its many golf courses and resorts as their primary residence. This includes people like the late Merv Griffin, retired baseball player Tommy John, Olympic figure skater Dorothy Hamill, singer Jack Jones, and Nike co-founder Phil Knight among others. Previous residents of the city, who notably grew up there, include musician/actor Tyler Hilton, pro golfer Anthony Kim, and singer/dancer Aubrey O’Day of Danity Kane.</p><h2><strong>Where Was Jenna Ortega Born?</strong></h2><p>Jenna Ortega was born in Coachella Valley, California, on September 27, 2002. She is the fourth of six children born to her parents, Edward and Natalie Ortega. Her father, Edward, is a businessman originally from Mexico, while Jenna’s mother, Natalie, is an emergency nurse who works at a local hospital. She is of Puerto Rican and Mexican descent.</p><p>Edward and Natalie Ortega have been very supportive of Jenna’s acting career and have always been there to help her with her lines and prepare for auditions. She began her acting career at the age of nine, appearing in the Disney Channel series Stuck in the Middle.</p><p>She has since starred in a number of films and television shows, including Jane the Virgin, which brought her to prominence, and the Netflix TV show Wednesday, for which her performance has earned her nominations at the Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, and Screen Actors Guild Awards.</p><h2><strong>What State Does Jenna Ortega Live In?</strong></h2><p>Jenna Ortega lives in the U.S. state of California. She has lived in the state all her life, as she was born in Coachella Valley in the Colorado Desert of Southern California in Riverside County. Jenna also attended school in the state. She attended John Glenn Middle School in Indio, California, for her seventh and eighth-grade years before quitting traditional school in 2018 to be homeschooled in order to focus on her acting career.</p><p>According to Jenna, her career did not allow her to “live a normal lifestyle,” as she missed out on experiences such as prom and graduation. Regardless, she has been able to live the dream of many people her age and have a successful career in Hollywood.</p><p>Ortega’s work also means that she gets to continue staying in California, where Hollywood is located. Unless she is going out of town for a few weeks or months to shoot a project, like she did to shoot Wednesday, which was filmed in Romania in Europe, Jenna Ortega will most likely be spending many more years of her life in California.</p><h2><strong>Did Jenna Ortega Die?</strong></h2><p>Jenna Ortega is not dead. While there have been some rumors that she died, these rumors have been found to be false as the actress is very fine and well. Ortega continues to take on roles in Hollywood and is very active on social media, where she has a large following on Instagram and Twitter. Her activity on these platforms and her appearance in new projects is a testament that she did not die.</p><p>Reports that say Jenna died may be as a result of the death of actress Lisa Loring, who originated the role of Wednesday Addams on screen. Loring was 6 years old when she appeared in the classic Addams Family TV series that aired from 1964 to 1966. She died after suffering a stroke in early 2023, and Jenna took to social media to<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> pay tribute</a> to her.</p><p>Other reasons that may have led to Jenna Ortega’s death rumors are the death of some of the characters she has played in the past. In the 2017 film Insidious: Chapter 4, she played a young girl named Quinn Brenner, who was possessed by a demon and was eventually killed after she jumped off a cliff. Years later, in the 2021 film The Fallout, Ortega played Vada Salazar, who was severely injured in a school shooting and eventually died from her injuries.</p><h2><strong>Where is Jenna Ortega Now?</strong></h2><p>Jenna Ortega is currently in her home state of California. She is currently working on a number of projects, including the second season of Wednesday and the upcoming films Scream VI and American Carnage. She is also developing a number of projects for her production company, Yes, Norman Productions.</p><h2><strong>What is Jenna Ortega’s Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Jenna Ortega’s net worth is estimated at $3 million. Her wealth is a result of her successful acting career as she has starred in a number of commercially successful films and TV shows, including Stuck in the Middle, Jane the Virgin, You, The Babysitter: Killer Queen, and Netflix’s Wednesday. Ortega is reportedly paid $100,000 and $200,000 per episode of the award-winning Netflix show.</p><p>Other income sources that have contributed to Jenna Ortega’s net worth include brand endorsements and social media. Ortega is a brand ambassador for companies like Neutrogena, Old Navy, and Target. She also makes money through sponsored posts and product endorsements on social media.</p><p>Jenna Ortega’s net worth will certainly increase in the coming years as her career grows. She is also going into movie production with the launch of her own production company called Yes, Norman Productions. She is developing several projects for television and film.</p><h3><strong>What is Jenna Ortega’s Fan Mail Address?</strong></h3><p>Jenna Ortega does not have a public fan mail address.
