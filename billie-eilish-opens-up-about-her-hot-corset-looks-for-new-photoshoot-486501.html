However, that’s not to say Billie Eilish can’t also rock styles that are of the completely opposite aesthetic and that’s exactly what she did for her British Vogue cover photoshoot!</p><p>Instead of baggy clothes, Billie looked absolutely stunning when she put on several corsets, giving off very elegant and sexy old Hollywood vibes.</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by BILLIE EILISH (@billieeilish)</p><p>It really feels like it’s a new era for the 19 year old, be it for her style or music, and she opened up about this and more during her interview for the magazine.</p><p>Billie also explained what made her want to try out this style.</p><p>‘I feel more like a woman, somehow,’ she mentioned, referring to seeing herself with honey blonde hair and in corsets.</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by BILLIE EILISH (@billieeilish)</p><p>But while she absolutely loves this look, Billie could not help but assume that there’s going to be a lot of criticism coming her way, mostly because she is a supporter of body positivity and corsets usually give the body a slimmer look.</p><p>Still, she’s not wasting much time worrying about that since she does whatever she wants regardless of what others think.</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by BILLIE EILISH (@billieeilish)</p><p>‘My thing is, I can do whatever I want. It is all about what makes you feel good. If you want to get surgery, get surgery. If you just want to wear a dress that someone thinks you look too big wearing, just f**k it – if you feel like you look good, you really look good.’</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by BILLIE EILISH (@billieeilish)</p><p>Billie also thinks her message in her new music, about men taking advantage of young girls under the age of consent, will also be mocked and not taken seriously enough just because of her sexy outfits in the shoot.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘Suddenly you are a hypocrite if you want to show your skin, and you are easy and a slut and a whore. Showing your body and showing your skin – or not – should not take any respect away from you,’ she explained her point of view, in part.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSnrmttcRmnKKkmai1brvPnqWsZaWleqKuzq6rZqCVp3qpu9Nmmqiqo5rBbrjOqKKsZZakv266xLBkqaCfqby0tM6oq2ZsaGuCcX2O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brooke-camhi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brooke Camhi Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonce-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Beyonc Net Worth: How the Queen of Pop Built Her Empire</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
