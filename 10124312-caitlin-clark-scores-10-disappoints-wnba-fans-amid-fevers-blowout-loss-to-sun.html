The team held Clark to 10 points on 3-of-8 shooting. She was limited to just 22 minutes on the floor due to foul trouble.</p><p>Connecticut (10-1) led by as many as 28 points in Monday's victory, which was its third over Indiana (3-10) this season. DiJonai Carrington recorded a season-high 22 points and also did an outstanding job defending Clark. DeWanna Bonner added 17 points and Alyssa Thomas chipped in seven points while pulling down 18 rebounds and dishing out seven assists.</p><p>With Clark having an off-game, the Fever were led by Aliyah Boston, who notched her second double-double of the season with 14 points and 12 rebounds.</p><p>However, it was Clark who was the subject of conversations on social media, as fans struggled to hold back their disappointment with her performance on Monday:</p>Teddyüíõ <span class=acct>@Teddy_20</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>caitlin clark desperately needs to work on incorporating a mid range floater in her game in the off season</p>J <span class=acct>@jjnorthridge</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Caitlin Clark still needs to develop a floater/teardrop in her game.

Caitlin Clark gets no screens for an open shot, then her team mates seem more concerned with running to their assigned than to keep an eye on Caitlin's play-maker pass.

While she handled the snub in stride and <a href=#>said she would use it as motivation</a>, she didn't show much fire in Monday's game.</p><p>The transition to the WNBA has been filled with ups and downs for Clark so far, but she has shown flashes of being the dominant player she was at Iowa. Unfortunately, Monday wasn't one of those instances.</p><p>Clark will look to bounce back on Thursday at home against the Atlanta Dream (5-4).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmAcn6MnJiirJyeu26vy5qppGWjmLyzsdJmaGlllJ7AorzPqKCnrKNixK%2BuwGadmqajYq6utcNmnZ6ulafAbq7LqK6oraRiubC%2F0marqGWjqrs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cured-burger-meat-crossword-clue-daily-themed-answer-with-3-letters-1160474.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cured burger meat Crossword Clue Daily Themed Answer With 3 letters</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brandi-glanville-claims-joanna-krupa-had-an-affair-with-yolanda-fosters-ex-husband-mohamed-hadid-20131211.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Brandi Glanville Claims Joanna Krupa Affair With Yolanda Foster's Ex</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
