That’s right, when VH1 launched the first installment in the Love & Hip Hop franchise back in 2011, it became very apparent that they had a hit on their hands. Now with several spin-offs, Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood is the latest and greatest, and as the show continues into its second season, the cast is full of plenty of drama. Hollywood may be known for being full of lights and excitement, but for this group, just trying to get through the day without being involved in a drink throwing contest is an accomplishment. But, as with any reality show, getting to know the cast is very important. With that being said, let’s go behind the cast of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lil Fizz</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2819389.jpg alt="Lil Fizz as a member of B2K" width=639 height=425 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the early 2000s, Lil Fizz rose to fame as a member of the boy group, B2K. Known as the rapper of the group, he tried to do his own thing when the group dissolved, but didn’t have much luck.&nbsp;When he joined the cast of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood, it was probably the first time fans had seen him in years. While he is still working on his music career, these days he is also a proud father who is all about putting his son first.</p><p>(Photo by Scott Gries/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Soulja Boy</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/88733204.jpg alt="Soul Boy Tell Em" width=639 height=429 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the mid 2000s, Soujla Boy’s “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” became one of the first in what has since become a long line of hip-hop songs with accompanying dances. At the time, Soulja’s claim to fame was that he was a teenager who produced and recorded all of his own music at home. Unfortunately, his lack of lyrical ability proved to be an issue when people got tired of dancing, but his production skills have allowed him to stay relevant in the industry behind the scenes. However, joining the cast of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood has helped to bring him back into the spotlight, but with his inability to be faithful to his girl,&nbsp;he usually isn’t making himself look too good.</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Hazel – E</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/455123062.jpg alt="Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood Premiere Event" width=640 height=421 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Ex-publicist turned rapper, Hazel E (pictured far left), is one of the show’s cast members who you probably never heard of before the show. But apparently, she’s been doing big things for a while now, and some of her clients as a publicist include Tank and Eva Pigford. Although her focus is currently on getting her music career off the group, she still seems pretty well-connected to some people in the industry.</p><p>(Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for VH1)</p><p><strong>Teairra Mari&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/53264015.jpg alt="Teairra Mari performing on stage" width=641 height=451 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>There was once a time when Teairra Mari was actually famous for being an artist. In 2005, her debut single “Make Her Feel Good,” found success on the charts, and her career seemed to be getting ready to take off. However, after releasing one album, she disappeared from the spotlight other than a few on-screen appearances. In 2011, she reappeared as a cast member on VH1’s original Love & Hip Hop series where she found herself (as usual) in the middle of some drama. Currently, a returning member to the cast of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood,&nbsp;Teairra is always in the middle of some sneaky scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Moniece Slaughter</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/462965494.jpg alt="Monica Slaughter at the GBK lounge" width=642 height=428 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As the baby mother of fellow cast member, Lil Fizz’ son, Moniece Slaughter’s past relationship has often overshadowed her on the show. But apparently, Moniece is an aspiring singer who actually sang the theme song for Tyra Banks’ America’s Next Top Model. Moniece is also trying to get her feet wet as a&nbsp;business woman looking to break into the sex toy industry.</p><p>(image via Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Omarion</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/455123348.jpg alt="Omarion and Apryl On The Red Carpet" width=639 height=409 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Former B2k front man, Omarion, has come a long way since his days as a member of the group. As the only one to go on to have a successful solo career, Omarion has been working in the industry for over a decade, and his career recently caught a huge second wind with the success if his hit single “Post To Be.” His 5th album is slated to drop this month, and it looks like his hard work is really paying off. However, when he isn’t busy laying down hits, Omarion is focused on being a great father to his song and a great boyfriend to his girl, Apryl, who is also on the show. According to both of their Instagram accounts, the couple is also expecting a daughter.</p><p>(Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for VH1)</p><p><strong>Ray J</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/177314801.jpg alt="Ray J at the BMI Awards" width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Ray J is probably the most familiar face in the Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood cast. As the younger brother of award-winning singer, Brandy, Ray J has been in the industry since he was just a kid, making appearances on sitcoms and starting a music career of his own. In 1995 he released his first musical project and throughout the 90s and early 2000s he found success with singles like “Wait A Minute.” In 2007, Ray was thrust into the spotlight when a sex tape between him and his then girlfriend, Kim Kardashian, leaked on the Internet. In&nbsp;2009, he starred on his own VH1 reality dating series, For The Love of Ray J,&nbsp;and also starred on a reality series with his family. These days, he seems to be focused on getting his career back on track, and is currently working on his 5th album.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for BMI)</p><p><strong>Milan Christopher and Miles Brock</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/COackhJWgAIPLsd.jpg alt="Milan And Miles Love & Hip Hop's first gay couple" width=640 height=347 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Described as Love & Hop Hop’s&nbsp;first gay couple, Milan Christopher and Miles Brock have been all over the <a href=#>celebrity news</a> sites, and these two are definitely shattering stereotypes. However, there’s way more to these guys than their sexuality. Aside from working behind the scenes in the music industry, Milan is the owner of several teeth whitening businesses. He is also the related to the legendary Barry Gordy by marriage. Miles&nbsp;is an aspiring rapper based in L.A. who made his film debut in the 2011 independent movie, The Broom Wedding.&nbsp;Brock also proudly holds two college degrees, and is hoping to get a third but is currently focusing on music.</p><p>image via&nbsp;https://twitter.com/_AccordingToT_</p><p>&nbsp;Lead (Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for VH1)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiZnqCZo7Fur8Csq2akn6uybrTIqWShp6BitbC4y7KuqKeUZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blac-chyna-teaches-you-how-to-thrive-and-survive-in-your-30s-with-the-grown-sexy-show-but-offends-some-fans-with-something-she-says-find-out-what-it-is-231477.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blac Chyna Teaches You How To Thrive And Survive In Your 30s With The Grown &amp;amp; Sexy Show, But O</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mistakenly-declared-dead.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>9 Times People Were Presumed Dead And Then Found Alive</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
