The couple has been together since 2019 and got married in January 2021.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While Michael Abbott’s life and career are quite a mystery to many, this is not the case for his partner, Jerick Roman Lamar Hoffer, who is popular with the stage name, Jinkx Monsoon. Jinkx is a winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race and uses they/them pronouns. Michael’s marriage to Jinkx earned him public attention but as you would soon learn, he has always been a known figure in the entertainment circles.</p><h3><b>Summary of Michael Abbott’s Biography</b></h3><ul><li><b>Full name:&nbsp;</b>Michael Abbott</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Male</li><li><b>Date of birth:&nbsp;</b>November 26, 1995</li><li><strong>Michael Abbott’s </strong><b>Age: </b>28 Years Old</li><li><b>Ethnicity:&nbsp;</b>Caucasian</li><li><b>Nationality:&nbsp;</b>English</li><li><b>Zodiac Sign:&nbsp;</b>Sagittarius</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation: </b>Queer</li><li><b>Marital Status:&nbsp;</b>Married</li><li><strong>Michael Abbott’s Husband</strong><b>:&nbsp;</b>Jinkx Monsoon</li><li><b>Famous for:&nbsp;</b>Marriage to Jinkx Monsoon</li><li><strong>Michael Abbott’s </strong><b>Instagram:&nbsp;</b>@hrhmichael</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old is Jinkx Monsoon’s Husband?</strong></h2><p>Jinkx Monsoon’s husband, Michael Abbott, is 28 years old. According to several reports, he was born on the 26th of November 1995. This means he is eight years younger than his famous spouse, Jinkx Monsoon. Jinkx was born on the 18th of September 1987 and they are 45 years old at the moment.</p><p>Michael Abbott’s famous partner was born and raised in Portland, Oregon as a Catholic. From their mother’s side of the family, they are of Russian-Jewish ancestry. Growing up, Jinkx Monsoon attended da Vinci Arts Middle School and Grant High School. They would later obtain a BFA in theater from Cornish College of the Arts in 2010. All of such of information about their husband, Michael Abbott, is not privy to the public.</p><p>At the moment, it is only known that Michael Abbott is from Manchester, England. Details of the family he was born into, who his parents/siblings are, the kind of childhood he had, and the schools he attended are yet to be uncovered. This is so because Abbott was not so much in the spotlight until his relationship with Jinkx Monsoon came to light.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>On his Instagram bio</a>, Abbott describes himself as a gifted child. According to him, he blossomed into an anxious adult with a fragile sense of self-worth. He also thinks of himself as a perfectionist. This, he says, makes him abandon things he’s not good at.</p><h2><strong>What Does Michael Abbott Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Like Jinkx Monsoon, Michael Abbott also works in the entertainment industry. The only difference is that he has not been on people’s faces like his partner. Jinkx is not only a drag performer but also a singer, actor, and comedian. Their mainstream popularity soared after they won the fifth season of RuPaul’s Drag Race and they consolidated on that when they won the seventh season of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars. This made Jinkx the first person to win two seasons of the show.</p><p>As for their husband, reports have it that he is a musician who has worked in the sound and music department of many Hollywood productions. According to the reports, his most notable works include The Voice&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;Riot (2014), and&nbsp;Wonderland (2016). From 2011 to 2015, Abbott worked as a broadcast audio mixer across 226 episodes of The Voice. This earned him five Primetime Emmy Awards nominations for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Variety Series or Special; consecutively from 2014 to 2018.</p><p>In some quarters, it has also been claimed that he is a video game producer, but this has not been meaningfully confirmed. In fact, the only thing we can confirm regarding what Michael Abbott does for a living is that he is a musician and also works as a bartender. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>According to The New York Times</a>, he was working as a bartender at a club in Manchester, England, when he met Jinkx Monsoon.</p><h2><strong>Michael Abbott and Jinkx Monsoon’s Love Story Began in March 2019</strong></h2><p>Fate brought the couple together in March 2019 when Jinkx Monsoon was on a tour in Manchester, England. As the story goes, Michael and Jinkx met for the first time at a club called Kiki. While the former works as a bartender in the club, the latter was just hanging out there. It is said that Jinkx had made plans to go out with another drag queen but was ghosted, so she decided to go out alone and ended up at Kiki.</p><p>Even though Jinkx Monsoon was already famous when they met Michael, he didn’t know anything about them and had little knowledge of what Drag Race is all about. Despite this, they had an instant connection that inspired Michael to go stay with Jinkx at their hotel room after he was done working that night. The drag performer recalls that they stayed up all night talking. That wasn’t enough, so they spent the whole of the following day together, watching television and learning more about each other.</p><p>Monsoon had a ukulele which they used for their drag performance. Being a musician, Michael knows how to play the instrument. So he picked it up and started playing random songs for Monsoon. By the time he was done, a strong feeling had materialized between them. The days that followed confirmed to them that they were in love as they were inseparable and often seen holding hands and singing in the streets of England.</p><h3><strong>They Had a Quiet Wedding in January 2021</strong></h3><p>When Jinkx Monsoon was done with her tour and set to return to the United States, they and Michael Abbott weren’t sure what the future held for them. While they were certain they were in love and wanted to date, they were skeptical about having a long-distance relationship. They eventually decided to give it a shot and it paved the way for them to get married.</p><p>Their relationship encountered some challenges when the travel ban came into being due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Without being able to travel to see each other, they resorted to FaceTime to keep in touch. Around this time, they started talking about getting married and in October 2020 when Michael got a 90-days clearance to travel to the United States, they had what Jinkx described as a pre-engagement.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">They eventually got married on the 9th of January 2021. Although Michael’s partner has always dreamed of having a massive Victorian wedding, the couple settled for a small, quiet wedding. This was because of the lockdown and social distancing requirement that the pandemic warranted. They exchanged their marital vows in their living room in Portland, Oregon. From what we gathered, their friend, comedian Devan Green, officiated the wedding virtually from California and only three guests witnessed the event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmmqScYq6ju9StZKOhnqDFbrnOp6qop56oeqnB0puYp5xdoraktMCeo2aZkpe8tcCO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./armored-core-6-battle-logs-locations-combat-logs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Armored Core 6 Battle Logs Locations (Combat Logs)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./4-best-breads-to-eat-for-blood-sugar-say-dietitians-eat-this-not-that.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>4 Best Breads To Eat for Blood Sugar, Say Dietitians Eat This Not That</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
