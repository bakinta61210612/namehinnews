She has three younger siblings, Camry, Jaxo, and Cade. She went to American Fork High School, where she met the love of her life, and after matriculation enrolled at Utah Valley University.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></span></h2><p>Witney started dancing at the age of three, having joined a dance studio where she began dance lessons. She didn’t have a specific dance, but trained all the genres, including ballet, ballroom, tap, hip-hop, jazz and others. Gradually she improved and started participating in various dance competitions, not only in the US but across the world as well. When she turned 18 years old, Witney auditioned to become a participant of the show “So You Think You Can Dance”, and reaching the top 20 contestants, was paired with Chehon Wespi-Tschopp, a professional ballet dancer, with whom she reached the seventh round before they were eliminated.</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Prominence><strong>Rise to Prominence</strong></span></h2><p>Witney steadily became more popular, and in 2013 was chosen for the show “Dancing with the Stars”, starting as a troupe dancer, but in 2014 was promoted to the main program and was partnered with Cody Simpson – the two were eliminated as the ninth pair from the show, but the following year Witney performed with Alfonso Ribeiro and they won the competition, which is one of her most successful endeavors. She has continued to feature in the show until the latest season but hasn’t managed to repeat the feat, even finishing 12th once when she performed with Chris Katta, but bounced back with a third place, dancing alongside Frankie Muniz, and then finished fourth with Chris Mazdzer. Most recently, she danced with Milo Manheim, with whom she reached the finals, but unfortunately finished second best, behind Bobby Bones and Sharna Burgess. To speak further of her accomplishments, Witney now serves as a mentor to children who compete in the “Dancing with the Stars: Junior”, which was launched in 2018.</p><h2><span id=Witney_Carson_Net_Worth><strong>Witney Carson Net Worth</strong></span></h2><p>All of her endeavors contributed to her wealth, especially her participation in the show “Dancing with the Stars”.
