They thought it was the best idea and the right time to part ways.</p><p>It was a complete shock for fans of both and a surprising U-turn from what Katy said in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres. She said, “We have music as an understanding and love between each other, and we connect,” she said. “It’s like he understands what I do because he does the same thing. And so after a long day, if it’s been tough, I don’t really have to go into it. He just gets it.”</p><p>However, the separation was painful for John Mayer. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>, he said that the song was about his relationship with Katy Perry. But, he added, “Who else would I be thinking about?” he told the newspaper. “And by the way, it’s a testament to the fact that I have not dated a lot of people in the last five, six years. That was my only relationship. So it’s like, give me this, people.”</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>Is John Mayer gay?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo6%2FRoquim6NjsLC5jqSYrbFdpbKzvthmoaignmK6osXEq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-talks-gq-woman-of-year-award-is-obsessed-with-ribs-201439.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Talks GQ Woman of Year Award, Is &amp;quot;Obsessed With Ribs&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jacqueline-laurita.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jacqueline Laurita News - Us Weekly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
