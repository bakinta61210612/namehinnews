However, as a 12-year-old in Part One of the Naruto anime series, he was 4 feet 9 inches tall. By the time Part two of the anime series (known as Naruto Shippuden) rolled around, he was in his late teens and had grown to a height of 5 feet 6 inches tall.</strong></p><p>Naruto’s 5 feet 11 inches height makes him one of the tallest characters in the Naruto/Boruto anime series, but he is not the tallest. That honor belongs to his former teammate, Sasuke Uchiha, who is as tall as 6 feet as an adult.</p><h2><strong>What is Naruto’s Height?</strong></h2><p>Naruto is <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">5 feet 11 inches tall</a> as an adult male, which is the same thing as 180 cm or 1.8m. It must, however, be remembered that his adventures and exploits start right from when he was a child. Naruto grew up in the village of Konoha and as was the norm there, joined the ninja academy at the age of six. He spent some years there and graduated by the time he was aged 12.</p><p>By the time he was aged 12 to 13, Naruto was a modest 4 feet 9 inches tall which is the same thing as 146 cm or 1.46 m. He had the height of an average teen of his age. Naruto will witness further physical development in Part two of the anime series titled Naruto Shippuden. Naruto Shippuden covered him from ages 15 – 17, and he was 5 feet 6 inches or 166 cm or 1.66 m tall.</p><p>The next time that we see Naruto, he is now a 32-year-old adult man and is 5 feet 11 inches tall. This is slightly above average when compared to the height of other adult males out there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Naruto.jpg><h2><strong>How Tall is Naruto in Boruto?</strong></h2><p>Naruto is 5 feet 11 inches tall (180 cm or 1.8m) in Boruto. This is because he is an adult in his early 30s by the time Boruto rolls around. As earlier stated, the anime series first chronicled his adventures as a child when he underwent ninja training and joined a team.<br>By the second part of the anime series, known as Naruto Shippuden, he is approaching his late teens.</p><p>About 17 years after Shippuden, we have Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. This can be referred to as the third or fourth part of Naruto. In Boruto, Naruto is said to be a 32-year-old male who is 5 feet 11 inches tall or 180 cm tall. This is quite impressive but does that make him the tallest character in the series? We shall soon find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Naruto-1.jpg><h2><strong>Naruto Characters Height</strong></h2><h3><strong>1.
