Fans—including judge <strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong>—are convinced the two should get married. However, Maks' brother <strong>Val Chmerkovskiy</strong> says their love is beyond the romantic.</p><p>"She was good for him, but I feel it wouldn't do their love justice," the DWTS pro, 28, told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> at <a href=#>the season 18 finale</a> on Tuesday. "One makeout session in the middle of the dance or to label it that they are a couple—it sounds great, but that's not what it is. He loves her probably more than I've seen him love another woman—he loves and adores her—but it's like a King Kong type of relationship."</p><p>Elaborating on that, he continued: "She's precious, and he's gentle with her because he wants to see her shine and he won't want to hurt her. He's willing to calm down for her because she's the last person he wants to see cry and the last person he wants to hurt."</p><p>That kind of love, Val said, is "bigger than a kiss" or a hookup—even though Maks, 34, joked on Tuesday's finale that he wanted to "ravish" his partner and have "big, ice-dancing" babies with her.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"He definitely loves her, and I know she loves him back," Val told <strong>Us</strong> of his brother, whose victory with Davis, 27, was his first in 14 seasons of competition. ("There's a reason it didn't happen before," Maks said on the finale. "It's because I was meant to do it with her.")</p><p>Val added, too, that the whole Chmerkovskiy family has fallen in love with Davis as a person. "We as a family love her, too. We love Meryl, but I don't know if they were meant for each other or just meant to be in each other's lives for this moment," he explained. "Or for many moments, definitely, as it's a friendship they'll keep for a very long time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOppikq12Wu6V5zJ6psqRdma61tc2gZKGdXaG8t7HSZp%2Beql2Xv7DAx56pZq6RoXqktMyeqaSnpqi4qsWMrJiyq11nfXKAkWps</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mauricio-ochmann.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mauricio Ochmann Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./madalyn-horcher-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Madalyn Horcher Bio: Net Worth, Age, Height, Family, Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
