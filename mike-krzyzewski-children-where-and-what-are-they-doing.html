His grandson Michael Savarino is currently playing for the Duke basketball team. Michael is Debbie’s son, and she is the eldest amongst the three. That said, let’s know more about Mike Krzyzewski’s children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Daughters_Debbie_And_Lindy></span>Daughters Debbie And Lindy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As addressed above, Michael’s daughter Debbie is the oldest amongst the three. However, when we last heard of her, she was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">recovering</a> from her stroke which was caused by a vertebral artery dissection. Apart from that, she is currently enjoying her marital life with her husband, <strong>Peter Savarino</strong>. Together the couple is parenting <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">four children</a>, two sons <strong>Joey Savarino</strong> and <strong>Michael Giovanni Savarino</strong> and two daughters, <strong>Emmie Savarino</strong>, and <strong>Carly Savarino</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mike-Krzyzewski-daughter-Debbie-with-son.jpg><p>Mike Krzyzewski’s daughter Lindy Frasher graduated from Wake Forest University with a B.S. in psychology and minors in Spanish and theater. Later she joined Pepperdine University and earned herself a master’s degree in clinical psychology. Whereas she is currently <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">working</a> as the Men’s Basketball Staff Counselor for the Duke basketball team. Not only that, but she is also the Dean of Upper School Girls at the Durham Academy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mike-Krzyzewski-daughter-Lindsey.jpg><p>Speaking of her love life, Lindy is married to her husband <strong>Steve Frasher</strong>. Furthermore, the lovely couple has three sons together, <strong>Quin Frasher</strong>, <strong>Remington Frasher</strong>, and <strong>Caden Frasher</strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Youngest_Daughter_Jamie></span>Youngest Daughter Jamie<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The youngest of Mike Krzyzewski’s daughters Jamie Spatola graduated from Duke in 2004 with a degree in English. She also owns an MBA degree from Cameron University and another masters’ degree in Liberal Studies from Duke. To date, she has co-authored two books with her beloved father, Mike, The Gold Standard and Beyond Basketball.</p><p>Furthermore, Jamie has been working as an executive assistant to the president of Cameron University since 2003. She reached English at a high school and also worked as the administrator of the Duke Men’s Basketball camp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mike-Krzyzewski-youngest-daughter.jpg><p>Moving on to her love life, she exchanged her vows with <b>Chris Spatola, </b>a U.S &nbsp;Army Captain. Together the couple has three kids, son <strong>John David Spatola</strong> and daughters <strong>Mackenzie Spatola</strong> and <strong>Madeline Spatola</strong>.</p><p><span style="font-family:open sans,Arial,Helvetica,nimbus sans l,sans-serif;font-size:24px">A Family Of Eighteen</span></p><p>As mentioned above, Mike is obviously a family guy. He never let’s his three daughters out of his sight. We all know how much of a great coach he is, so it must not come as a surprise that his grandson Michael is good at basketball. Maybe the old man suggests some tips and tricks for his grandson to become a great player.</p><p>Nevertheless, all of Mike Krzyzewski’s daughters share a special bond with him and with each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mike-Krzyzewski-and-family.jpg><p>We can find many pictures of the lovely family on the Internet, and if that’s not enough to prove their love for one another, then you can just follow them on their social media. The lovely bonding between the sisters clearly reflects on their social media page.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Family_Guy_Retires_Finally></span>The Family Guy Retires Finally<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Duke Blue Devils head coach, Mike Krzyzewski finally retires after 41 seasons. His retirement was announced by Duke University on June 2nd, 2021.</p><p>Coach K who had NBA stars like <strong>Zion Williamson</strong>, <strong>Kyrie Irving</strong>, <strong>Jason Tatum</strong>, and <strong>Grant Hill</strong> under his belt retired mostly to spend time with his family.</p><p>He even mentioned –</p><p>“My family and I view this as a celebration.”</p><p>Knowing that he is gone, Duke’s associate head coach <strong>Jon Scheyer</strong> is named his successor.</p><p>Now to conclude, Mike is not only an excellent coach but also a successful husband and a proud father as well as a grandfather.</p><p>Mike Krzyzewski’s last home game ended with a 94-81 loss to North Caroline on March 5, 2022, at Cameron Indoor Stadium. This game was supposed to be the celebration for the coach, but sadly, Duke lost against North Caroline. Even though his last game was a loss, while delivering his farewell speech, the coach seemed to be glad it was done. Nevertheless, he had a well-storied and great 42 years of his career as a coach.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mike_Krzyzewskis_Children_Name_Meaning></span>Mike Krzyzewski’s Children Name Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mike Krzyzewski’s daughter, Debbie Savarino’s name, is of Hebrew origin, meaning Bee. Whereas Lindy Frasher’s name is of English origin and the meaning behind the name is beautiful; pretty; sweet.</p><p>On the other hand, Mike Krzyzewski’s youngest daughter Jamie Spatola’s name is of Hebrew origin, meaning supplanter.</p><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<i><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>YouTubers</a>,&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & TV Series</a></strong>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>eCelebrityMirror</strong></i></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq7JlkpavqrHSaKSio5ViuLPG2LOcsKubnnqktMilm6udnmLEqbHRnmSappRixKmt02aYq51dqbWmxYydpqKml2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./whatever-happened-to-the-cast-of-home-improvement-we-ve-got-the-answer-38562.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>More Than 20 Years After Home Improvement Ended, See Tim Allen and the Rest of the Cast Then a</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./khloe-kardashians-boyfriend-french-montana-30000-worth-birthday-jewelry-2014286.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Khloe Kardashian's Beau French Montana Buys $30,000 Worth of Jewelry</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-godfather-reunion-robert-duvall-james-caan-and-francis-ford-coppola-celebrate-new-year-s-eve-together-48790.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./free-refrigerator-html.html>___-free refrigerator</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1998-18-across-novel-about-a-missing-woman-that-was-made-into-a-2007-ben-affleck-film-3-wds-html.html>1998 18-Across novel about a missing woman that was made into a 2007 Ben Affleck film: 3 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./al-brooks-net-worth.html>Al Brooks Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andrew-ribeiro.html>Andrew Ribeiro - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVib.
