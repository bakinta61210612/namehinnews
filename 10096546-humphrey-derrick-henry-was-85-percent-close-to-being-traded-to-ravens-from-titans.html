The lone exception was when he rushed for 937 yards and 10 scores in just eight games in 2021.</p><p>King Henry led the NFL in rushing in 2019 (1,540 yards) and 2020 (2,027 yards), and he rushed for 1,538 yards last season as well.</p><p>He has also rushed for a remarkable 72 touchdowns in 79 games dating back to the 2018 season.</p><p>In the first game of the 2023 campaign, the Ravens lost starting running J.K. Dobbins for the season with a torn Achilles, which has largely forced them to go with the combination of Gus Edwards and Justice Hill in the backfield.</p><p>Baltimore has not missed a beat, as its 7-2 record is tied with the Kansas City Chiefs for the best mark in the AFC.</p><p>With quarterback Lamar Jackson at the controls, the Ravens rushed for 298 yards as a team in a 37-3 drubbing of the Seattle Seahawks this past weekend.</p><p>Jackson, Edwards and Hill all contributed to the ground game, but the breakout star was undrafted rookie Keaton Mitchell, who rushed for 138 yards and a touchdown on nine carries.</p><p>Given Mitchell's showing and how successful Baltimore's ground game has been, Humphrey suggested Wednesday that the Ravens may not have needed a star running back like Henry after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWuCdYKMoaymqJinsrp5w56pq6GToHqpsc2rsGavkah6eYGMqZyrm5WjwW6vy6iqnmWkpHqjscinnmasopaxprCMraZmqpGrsq%2B%2FjJ%2BpqKVdqba1rc2s</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hans-kim-girlfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is He Dating Rachel Ramiro As Of 2</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-tall-is-naruto-his-height-compared-to-other-characters.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Tall Is Naruto?
