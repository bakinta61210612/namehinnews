Prior to his death, the most recent people to lie in the state were former President George H. W. Bush in December 2018 and Sen.

His predecessor, Lena King Lee, raised funds and campaigned for him; years later, Cummings credited her with launching his political career. In the Maryland General Assembly, he served as Chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. He was the first African American in Maryland history to be the Speaker Pro Tempore. Also, the second-highest position in the House of Delegates. Cummings also served on several boards and commissions, both in and out of Baltimore.

Cummings received praise following the congressional panel hearings on steroids in 2008. While investigating the use of steroids in sports, the panel called numerous baseball players to testify, including former single-season home run record holder Mark McGwire. After McGwire answered many questions in a vague fashion, Cummings demanded to know if he was “taking the Fifth”, referring to the Fifth Amendment. McGwire responded by saying, “I am here to talk about the future, not about the past.” The exchange came to epitomize the entire inquiry.</p><h4><span>More about his career</span></h4><p>Cummings introduced the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, a bipartisan bill signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in December 2014. The bill, which Cummings co-sponsored with Representative Darrell Issa, (R-California), is a set of amendments to the Federal Records Act and Presidential Records Act. Among other provisions, the bill modernizes the definition of a federal record to expressly include electronic documents.</p><p>He supported the Smart Savings Act, a bill that would make the default investment in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) an age-appropriate target-date asset allocation investment fund (L Fund) instead of the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund).&nbsp; Cummings called the bill a “commonsense change” and argued that the bill “will enable workers to take full advantage of a diversified fund designed to yield higher returns”. He introduced the All Circuit Review Extension Act.</p><p>A bill that would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to file their appeal at any U.S. circuit court of appeals, instead of only the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. He also said that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has “an abysmal track record in whistleblower cases”. In remarks at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Cummings declared: “Our party does not just believe, but understands, that Black Lives Matter. But we also recognize that our community and our law enforcement work best when they work together.”</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-65628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Elijah-Cummings-giving-a-speech.jpg alt="Elijah Cummings" width=650 height=517 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-65628 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Elijah Cummings giving a speech (Source: Instagram)</p><h4>Awards and Nomination</h4><p>He was awarded many honors and awards in recognition of his political career.
